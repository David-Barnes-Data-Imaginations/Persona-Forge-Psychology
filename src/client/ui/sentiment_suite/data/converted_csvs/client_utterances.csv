Client,2,"Yes, I am."
Client,3,"Well, right now I'm nervous  but I feel more comfortable the way you are talking in a low voice and I don't feel like you'll be so harsh on me. But, ah ..."
Client,4,"Uh, well, the main thing I um, want to talk to you about is uh, I'm just newly divorced and uh I had gone in therapy before and I felt comfortable when I left, and all of a sudden now the biggest change is adjusting to my single life.  And uh one of the things that bothers me the most is especially men, and having men to the house and how it affects the children  and- Uh, the biggest thing I want - the thing that keeps coming to my mind I want to tell you about is that I have a daughter, nine, who at one time I felt had a lot of emotional problems. I wish I could stop shaking . And uh, I'm real conscious of things affecting her. I don't want her to get upset, I don't want to shock her. I want so bad to- for her to accept me. And we're real open with each other especially about sex. And the other day she saw a girl that was single but pregnant and she asked me all about ""can girls get pregnant if they are single?"" And the conversation was fine and I wasn’t un- at ease at all with her until she asked me if I had ever made love to a man since I left her daddy and I lied to her. And ever since that, it keeps Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 5 coming up to my mind because I feel so guilty lying to her because I never lie and I want her to trust me. And I want- I almost want an answer from you. I want you to tell me if it would affect her wrong if I told her the truth, or what."
Client,5,"Yes. I feel like I have to be on guard about that  because I remember when I was a little girl, when I first found out my mother and father made love, that was dirty and terrible, and I didn't- I didn’t like her any more for awhile. And I don't want to lie to Pammy either and I don't know..."
Client,6,I was afraid you were going to say that .
Client,7,I want to especially know if it would affect her if I was completely honest and open with her or if it would affect her because I lied. I feel like it is bound to make a strain because I lied to her. [Words lost]
Client,8,"I feel that in time she will distrust me, yes . And also I thought well, gee, what about when she gets a little older and she finds herself in touchy situations. She probably wouldn't want to admit it to me because she thinks I'm so good and so sweet.  And yet I'm afraid she could think I'm really a- a devil. And I want so bad for her to accept me. And I don't know how much a nine-year-old can take."
Client,9,Yes.
Client,10,Not worse than I am.  I don't know if she can accept me the way I am. I think I paint a picture that I'm all sweet and motherly. And -- I'm a little ashamed of my shady side too.
Client,11,"This is what I don't know. Yeah. I don't want her to turn away from me.  And I don't even know how I feel about it because there are times when I feel so guilty like when I have a man over, I even try to make a special set-up so that if I were ever alone with him, the children would never catch me in that sort of thing. Because I'm real leery about it . And yet I also know that I have these desires."
Client,12,And my guilt. Yeah. Yeah.  I feel guilty so often.
Client,13,"Yes  and I don't like the ... I would like to feel comfortable with whatever I do. If I choose not to tell Pammy the truth, to feel comfortable that she can handle it,  and I don't. I want to be honest, and yet I feel there are some areas that I don't even accept  ."
Client,14,Right.
Client,15,"Right.   And I, I, I have a feeling that you are just going to sit there and let me stew in it  and I- I want more. I want you to help me get rid of my guilt feeling. If I can get rid of my guilt feeling about lying or going to bed with a single man, any of that, just so I can feel more comfortable."
Client,16,"Well, I appreciate you saying that.  You sound like you mean it. But I don't know where to go.  I don't begin to know where to go. I thought that I had pretty well worked over most of my guilt, and now that this is coming up I'm disappointed in myself.  I really am. I want- I like it when I feel that no matter what I do, even if it's against my own morals or my upbringing, that I can still feel good about me. And now I don't. Like uh, there's a girl at work who sort of mothers Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 7 me and she just- she- I think she thinks I'm all sweet, and I sure don't want to show my more ornery devilish side with her. I want to be sweet and it's so hard for me to - this all seems so new again  and it's so disappointing."
Client,17,Yes.
Client,18,"Yes, and do you know what I can find, doctor,  is that everything I start to do that I st- impulsive, seems natural to tell Pammy, or- or to go out on a date or something, I’m comfortable until I think how I was affected as a child and the minute that comes up, then I'm all haywire.  Like uh, I want to be a good mother so bad, and I feel like I am a good mother,  but then there's those little exceptions. Like my guilts with working. I want to work and it's so fun having extra money. I like to work nights. The minute I think I'm not being real good to the children or giving them enough time, then I start feeling guilty again. Then, that’s when I- it’s uh- what do they call it?  A double bind. That's just what it feels like. I want to do this and it feels right, but after all I'm not being a good mother and I want to be both. I am becoming more and more aware of what a perfectionist I am. That is what it seems I want to be so perfect. Either I want to become perfect in my standards, or not have that need any more."
Client,19,"Gee, I don't feel like I am saying that.  No, that isn't what I feel, really. I want to approve of me always, but my actions won't let me. I want to approve of me.  I – I think-"
Client,20,"Right.  Like I feel that I can't approve of myself regarding, for example , my sex life.  This is the big thing. If I really fell in love with a man and I respected him and I adored him, I don't think I would feel so guilty going to bed with him and I don't think I would have to make up any excuses to the children because they could see my natural caring for him.  But Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 8 when I have the physical desires and I'll say, ""Oh well, why not,"" and I want to anyway, but I feel guilty afterwards. I hate facing the kids, I don't like looking at myself, and I rarely enjoy it. And this is what I mean. If the circumstances would be different, I don't think I'd feel so guilty because I'd feel right about it."
Client,21,"That's how I feel, yeah.  And I know that sounds like I want a perfect situation, but that is how I feel. And in the meantime, I can't stop these desires. I tried that also. I’ve tried saying, ""O.K., I don't like myself when I do that so I won't do it any more."" But then I resent the children. I think, why should they stop me from doing what I want, and it is really not that bad."
Client,22,"Right. I'm sure that - I know that's it, probably even more so than I'm aware of. But I only notice it so much when I pick it up in the children. Then I can also notice it in myself."
Client,23,"Well, a sex life, I could say, not normal because there is something about me that says that's not very healthy – to uh just go into sex because you feel physically attracted or something, or a physical need. So, something about it tells me that that's not quite right anyway."
Client,24,Right. Right.
Client,25,"I wish I could. That's it, and I can't - now I feel like I- I can't control myself as well as I could have before. For a specific reason now, I can't. I just let go and I have- there’s too many things I do wrong that I have to feel guilty for, and I sure don't like that. I want you very much to give me a direct answer, and I'm going to ask it, and I don't expect a direct answer,  but I want to know. Do you feel that - to me the most important thing is to be open and honest and if I can be Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 9 open and honest with my children, do you feel that it could harm them? If for example, I could say to Pammy, ""I was- I felt bad lying to you, Pammy, and I want to tell you the truth now,"" and if I tell her the truth and she’s shocked at me and she’s upset, that that could bother her more? I was- I want to get rid of my guilts and that will help me, but I don't want to put ‘em on her."
Client,26,Do you feel that that could hurt her?
Client,27,"Right. All right. Now I hear what you are sayin’.   Then all right, then I want to work on  -- I wanna work on accepting me, then. I want to work on feeling all right about it. But that makes sense. That that will come natural and then I won't have to worry about Pammy.  But when things do seem so wrong for me and I have an impulse to do them, how can I accept that?"
Client,28,"Right. And I feel like, I feel like…"
Client,29,"Yeah, I feel like you are going to say, ""Now why do you think they’re wrong?"" and uh, I have mixed feelings there too.  Through therapy I will say, ""Now look, I know this is natural. Women feel it - sure, we don't talk about it lots socially but all women feel it and it's very natural."" I have had sex for the last 11 years and I’m- of course going to want it, but I still think it is wrong unless you’re really, truly in love with a man, and my body doesn't seem to agree. And so I don't know how to accept it."
Client,30,"Right.   Well, I have a Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 10 hopeless feeling.  I mean, these are all the things that I sort of feel myself, and I feel uh - O.K., now what?"
Client,32,"I wish you would say to me : to be honest and take the risk that Pammy’s going to accept me. And I also have a feeling if I could really risk it with Pammy, of all people, that I'd be able to say, ""Here's this little kid that can accept me, and I'm really not that bad."" If she really knows what a demon I am and still loves me and accepts me, it seems like it would help me to accept me more - like it's really not that bad.  I want you to say to go ahead and be honest, but I don't want the responsibility that it would upset her.  That is where I don't want to take responsibility."
Client,33,"Yes. Like I wonder if my mother had been more open with me, maybe I wouldn't have had such a narrow attitude about sex. If I would have thought that she could be, you know, pretty sexy and ornery, and devilish too, that I wouldn't look at her as being such a sweet mother, that she could also be the other side. But she didn't talk about that.   Maybe that's where I got my picture. I don't know, but I want Pammy to see me as a full woman, but also accept me."
Client,34,I don't?  What do you mean?
Client,35,"I would, but I don't want to quite take the risk of doing it  unless an authority tells me that … Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 11"
Client,36,"Yeah. But then if I don't take the chance, if I feel loved and accepted by her, I'll never feel good about it anyway."
Client,37,"Yeah, that’s what I mean, yes. But I also feel there is a lot of responsibility with being a mother. With I don’t- I don't want to feel like I have caused any big traumas in the children. I don't like all that responsibility. I think that's it. I don't like it, feeling it could be my fault."
Client,38,It is.
Client,39,"And you know, I- I look at it two ways. I like to see myself as being so honest with the kids, and really being proud of myself so that no matter what I told them or no matter how bad they think I was, I was honest   and down deep it’s gonna be a much more wholesome relationship, and yet you know, I get jealous of like when they are with their daddy. I feel he’s more flip, he’s not quite as real, he’s not quite as honest, but nevertheless, they see a sweet picture of their dad. You know, he is all goodness and light, and I am envious of that too. I want them to see me just as sweet as they see him and yet I know he is not quite as real with them. So it seems like I've got to swap the one for the other, and I know this is really what I want the most, but uh, I miss some of that glory."
Client,41,"That's right. You know that's exactly it. Before therapy, I would have definitely chosen the other area. I’m going to get respect from them no matter what - even if I have to lie."
Client,42,"But right now, I know that's not true  and I'm not positive they'll truly accept me. Something tells me they will. I know they will, but I am not positive. I want reassurance. I keep wanting these things."
Client,43,"Yes. Yes. That's why I get encouraged when I read in a book from somebody I respect and admire, that this is the right thing no matter what - honesty will win out. Well then, that keeps giving me confidence. “By gosh, I'm right.” But I ..."
Client,44,"Which makes me feel rea- very immature. I don't like this in me. I wish I were grown up enough or mature enough to make my decisions and stick by them, but I need somebody to help me on - somebody to push me."
Client,45,"Right. Right. And take more risks. I wish I’d take more risks. I wish that I could just go ahead and be this and say, however the children grow up, I've done my best. I didn’t have to constantly have this conflict. And I'd like, in later years, to say, ""No matter what you asked me kids, at least I told you the truth. You may not have liked it, but it's been the truth.""  That, somehow, I can admire.  I- I disrespect people that lie. I hate it so, you see what a double bind I am in. I hate myself if I'm bad, but I also hate myself if I lie. So uh, it's accepting. I want to become more accepting."
Client,46,"I do. I do because this has really bothered me. This happened with Pammy about a month ago and it keeps coming to my mind. I don't know whether to go back and talk to her about it or wait. She may have even forgotten what she asked me, but uh – it justRogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 13"
Client,47,"I haven... No, I haven't. And I would like, at least, to be able to tell her that I remember lying and I am sorry I lied and it has been driving me bugs because I did.  I do- Now I feel like - now that's solved - and I didn't even solve a thing, but I feel relieved.  I uh- I do feel like you have been saying to me – you’re not say- giving me advice, but I do feel like you are saying, ""You really wanna- You know what pattern you want to follow Gloria, and go ahead and follow it."" I sort of feel a backing up from you."
Client,48,Are you telling me...
Client,49,"But then there's also a conflict there because I am not really positive what I wanna do. The lying part, yes, but I am not positive what I wanna do when I go against myself.  Like when I bring a man to the house. I am not sure I want to do that. If I feel guilty afterward, I must not have really wanted to."
Client,50,"Yes. You know, this is so different. Now this kind of thing we are talking about now, it isn't just knowing whether you want to do something or not. If I want to go to work in the morning or if I don't want to go to work, that's easy.  But when I find myself doing something I don't feel comfortable with, I automatically say, ""If you’re not comfortable Gloria, it’s not right. Something’s wrong."" All right now. What I want to ask you is, how can I know which is the strongest? Because I do it, does that mean that’s the strongest? And yet, if I disapproved, that's just part of the thing that’s got to go along with it? You see, it sounds like you...  I'm picking up a contradiction. I’m not under- I’m not following."
Client,51,"Yes, and I have at times, when I’ve made a decision. Now that seems right.  That seems perfectly right - no conflict - but then there are times I do things Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 14 that I feel uncomfortable with. So that there is a conflict there.  It's not the same at all. So, what I'm saying is, how do I really know when I am following my true feelings, if I have conflicts afterwards or guilt afterwards?"
Client,52,Yes. Like if I’m starting to do it -- O.K.
Client,53,"You know, the most outstanding thing - I don't know if you are following me, when I say about this conflict - the one thing I know is I’ve wanted, for example, to leave my husband for quite a few years. I never did it. I kept thinking how nice it would be, or how scary it would be, but I never did it. And all of a sudden when I did, it felt right. I didn't feel mean toward him. I just knew this was what I had to do. That's when I know I am following myself. I am following my feelings completely. I have no conflict there. Some unhappy things came from it , but I still have no conflict. That, to me, is when I am following my feelings. And in everyday life the small little decisions, the small little things to do don't come out that clear at all. So many conflicts come with them.  Is this natural?"
Client,54,I do. I do.  And I miss that feeling other times. And it's right away a clue to me.
Client,55,"But yet, many times I will go along and do it anyway. And say, ""Oh well, I'm in the situation now, I'll just remember next time."" I mentioned this word a lot in therapy and most therapists grin at me or giggle or something when I say ""utopia,"" but when I do follow a feeling and I feel this good feeling inside of me, that's sort of utopia. That's what I mean. That's the way I like to feel whether it's a bad thing or a good thing. But I feel right about me. This is what I wanna…"
Client,56,"Yes. Yeah, it gives me a choked up feeling when you say that because I don't get that as often as I'd like.  I like that whole feeling. That's real precious to me."
Client,57,"Yeah, and you know what else I was just thinking? I – I feel dumb saying it uh - that all of a sudden while I was talking to you I thought, ""Gee, how nice I can talk to you and I want you to approve of me and I respect you, but I miss that my father couldn't talk to me like you are.""  I mean, I'd like to say, ""Gee, I'd like you for my father.""  I don't even know why that came to me."
Client,58,"Yeah, I couldn't be open, but I, I wanna blame it on him. I think I’m more open than he'd allow me. He would never listen to me talk like you are and not disapprove, not lower me down. I thought of this the other day. Why do I always have to be so perfect? I know why. He always wanted me to be perfect. I always had to be better  and uh... yeah, I miss that."
Client,59,"Yet at the same time, rebelling."
Client,60,"Like I almost gloated writing him a letter the other day and telling him I am a waitress, which I expect him to disapprove of. I go out at nights and I almost gloated hitting him back - like, ""Now how do you like me?""  And yet, I really want acceptance and love from him. I mean, I know he loves me."
Client,61,"Yeah.  ""You raised me, how do you like it?"" But do you know what I want him to say? ""I knew this was you all along, honey, and I really love you."""
Client,62,"No. He won't. He doesn't hear.  I went back home to him about two years ago, really wanting to let him know I loved him although I’ve Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 16 been afraid of him. And he doesn't hear me. He just keeps saying things like, ""Honey, you know I love you. You know I have always loved you."" He doesn't hear."
Client,63,"I don't know what it is. You know, when I talk about it, it feels more flip. If I just sit still a minute, it feels like a great big hurt down there. That I uh, feel cheated."
Client,64,"Mhm.  And again, that's a hopeless situation. I tried working on it, and uh, I feel it's something I have to accept. My father just isn't the type of man I'd really like. I'd like somebody more understanding and caring. He cares, but not in the way that we can cooperate or communicate."
Client,65,"Mhm. That is why I like substitutes. Like I like talking to you and I like men that I can respect. Doctors, and I keep sort of maybe underneath a feeling like we’re real close, you know, and it’s sort of like a substitute father."
Client,66,"Well, you are not really my father ."
Client,67,"Well, see, I sort of feel that's pretending too, because I can't expect you to feel very close to me. You don't know me that well."
Client,68,"[The remainder is not on the film – only on audio recording] Well, O.K., I'd just like more of it I guess."
Client,69,"Exactly. And I have been so busy trying to get rid of my neurosis. I'd like to have this one neurosis filled. I'd like to just find someone who is going to love me like a father. I even want this in boyfriends. I always want to get an older man that's Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 17 caring and more mature and not so flip."
Client,70,"That's right. And it seems ironic that since I have been away from my husband, the only type of man I go out with are the kind I don't respect - are the young, flip, not caring, 'smart aleck' kind of guy. Not somebody that's really, you know, that I can respect. That seems like such a big thing."
Client,71,Oh? By wanting mature men?
Client,72,"But I don't mean to. I don't understand why they keep coming around. END of FILM and AUDIORECORDING Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Interview, page 18 Rogers’ Post-Session Commentary In spite of feeling initially the artificiality of the situation, particularly the hot lights, I very quickly became oblivious to the outside situation, and I think that Gloria did too. In many ways I'm glad that she kept pushing me for an answer to her very personal questions about her sex life and her relationship to her daughter. I say I'm glad of this because as the relationship developed, it became I think completely clear to her as well as to me that she was seeking something a good deal deeper than that. Incidentally, I'd like to pay my tribute to her deep honesty in being willing to talk about herself so freely. Although every individual is entirely unique, and in this respect I was definitely unprepared for and sometimes surprised by the material she brought up - still, in another sense, this was very typical of my experiences in therapy. When I am able really to let myself enter into a relationship, and I feel that this was true in this instance, then I find myself not only being increasingly moved by being in touch with the inner world of my client, but I find myself bringing out my own inner experience, statements which seem to have no connection with what's going on, but which usually prove to be, or prove to have, a very significant relationship to what the client is experiencing. I felt there were one o two incidents of this kind in this brief interview. I was genuinely moved, I probably showed it, by the fact that she told me near the end of the contact that, uh, she saw me as the father she would like to have. My reply was also a thoroughly spontaneous one that she seemed to me like a pretty nice daughter. I guess I feel that we're only playing with the real world of relationships when we talk about such an experience in terms of transference and counter-transference. I feel quite deeply about that. I want to say, yes, we can put this experience into some such highly intellectualized framework, but when we do Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Gloria Post-Session Commentary, page 19 that it completely misses the point of the very immediate ""I-Thou"" quality of the relationship at such moments. I felt that Gloria and I really encountered each other and that in some small but, I believe, lasting way, we were each of us enriched by the experience. I am saying these things almost immediately after the conclusion of the interview and as is characteristic of me, there are not more than one or two statements or incidents which I recall from the interview. I simply know that I was very much present in the relationship, that I lived it in the moment of its occurrence, and I realize that after a time I may begin to remember it too. But at the present time, I really have a very non-specific memory of the whole interview. I'll try to look at it, though, a little bit more from an intellectual rather than a strictly feeling point of view. Gloria showed what I have come to feel are characteristic elements of therapeutic movement. In the first part of the interview, she was talking about her feelings and they were past feelings.. She was talking about aspects of her behavior and of herself as if she didn't quite own them. She was looking outside herself for a center, or a locus of evaluation, some source of authority. She saw some of the things she was talking about in fairly black and white fashion. By the end of the interview, she was experiencing her feelings in the immediate moment, not only as evidenced by her tears, but by her ability to express very directly and with immediacy her feelings toward me. She was also much more aware of her ability to make her own judgments and choices. I guess, put in terms that have become somewhat commonplace, you could say that she moved from the ""there and then"" of her life to the ""here and now"" of elements that she was discovering in herself feelings which she was experiencing in the moment in her relationship with me. All in all, I feel good about the interview. I guess I feel good about myself in the interview and like Gloria, I feel very real regret that the relationship cannot continue.

Carl Rogers’ 4th Interview with Sylvia [Film].] After filming, comments by Sylvia and Rogers were inserted. The bracketed italicized dialogue indicates the voiced over comments. [Carl Rogers: This is my fourth interview with Sylvia. A year previous, Sylvia had been a member of a workshop in which I offered to put on a demonstration interview. I asked for volunteers and she was the first one to volunteer. In front of that workshop audience, I held three interviews with Sylvia. Then a year, uh, intervened before this fourth interview. The interview will be, uh, shown as it was recorded, but with, uh, comments both from Sylvia and from myself, at points where we felt we wished to clarify what was going on, uh, or to, to, uh, make some comment about what was going on.] Carl: Hi. Sylvia: Hi Carl.  C: Good to see ya. S 1: I’ve been looking forward to this moment. C 1: Well, I’m eager to know what’s what with you. S 2:    Well, do you mean in terms of the past year or right now? 1 This Sylvia, in session #4, is the same person as the client in the film “The Struggle for Self-Acceptance” - session #5 with Sylvia. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 21 C 2: Oh, right now, whatever your concerns are in your present life.  I guess that’s what I’m interested in. S 2: Well, um,  I come here with an agenda,  like, of a particular thing I’d like to discuss with you.  And, and I think that discussing it will be helpful in terms of my, of my life. C 2: Uh-huh. Then that’s what I’d like you to discuss. S 3: Well, I think I’m doing very well in many ways, and I need to do some work,  too.  And, uh, the most pressing thing with me is that I plan to go to work in the fall,  full-time,  and have the care of both of my sons.  Without any support other than what I’m earning.  And I, and I, I don’t feel very upset about it, but I believe that deep down in my body I’m really afraid.  C 3: Are you afraid of the responsibility or, or what aspect of it is most frightening? S 4: Well what, what seems most frightening as I think about it is coming home from work very tired  and having, um, two little boys that need a lot.   C 4: Will you really be able to be a mother to them when they,  when you come home from work. Hmmm? S 5: Well, I’m sure I can do it  because I, it’s done every day. And, uh, the women I know an… who are trying to do that are having a really hard time.   And I’ve been thinking about talking about this problem now with you. I haven’t really… I, I talk about in a heady way with my friends, and, uh, I haven’t given myself any real support  with it. It’s a real fear I Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 22 have, and it’ll probably be really hard.  [Carl: It’s interesting that, uh, because she had saved up this problem to talk about that the moment she begins to talk about it she begins to, to, uh, get teary - that’s why I reached for the, uh, Kleenex, which she didn’t use. But, uh, it’s evident that, uh, though she may have talked about it in a, in an intellectual fashion to her friends, uh, it really does have a lot of emotional import for her.] [Sylvia: Well, I, I don’t know if it’s obvious to you but I started to cry when I said that and you know why, you know, I was feeling a lot of sadness.] C 5:  And you haven’t really had a chance to explore it in, in depth; you’ve talked about it more on a, on the surface level. S 5: Well, the exploring I’ve done is…  I decided for myself- well simple, I’ll look for other single working mothers  with young children who are doing well.  And I’ll talk to them and see what they do.  So I started asking, asking my friends, asking some people I know, “Do you know of this kind of person?” Well after about a month,  I didn’t come up with one,  one single woman taking care of young children and working full-time who was doing very well  and that scared me. C 6: So the track record, the track record that the other people have, the other women have makes you really concerned about will you be able to do it? S 7: Well that substantiates my concern. C 8: Yeah. Yeah. S 9: I’ve had the concern.    I wish,  I keep wishing I could find some secrets to make it easier for myself. And Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 23 the only secrets I can come up with are working half-time  and being really, like, no…  just barely, you know, paying rent and  food and so forth and so on.  But, I do know how to do that  and that may be what I decide to do. C 9: It’s one possible option at any rate. Mhm. S 10: But it seems like a real limited lifestyle. C 10: It is clear to me from the, from the tears that came up the first that, that, uh, this is something you feel a lot of concern about, isn’t it? S 11: Oh, I feel I’m two things . All alone  and somewhat doomed to fail. [Carl: I think, at this part, she was feeling, um, uh, quite discouraged after following a very good plan. Some of the responses along here are almost mechanical, like, um, my saying that’s another option. But then when I do pick up on the, uh, feeling that she had exhibited at the first, it, uh, brings up fresh all of the feeling that’s, uh, stirred up around that. And, uh, I think my response shows that I’m doing what I, what I customarily try to do. It is to live in the client’s experience and to feel whatever she’s feeling. This is the important thing to really go with the client into whatever feelings there are. And here I really go with her into her sadness. At times I, uh, feel almost as though I’m speaking for the client. And to me that’s, um, the relationship is good at those times. I feel as though, uh, I’m in the client’s world. I’m saying things that she could be saying. And, uh, when she says, “That’s right” it shows I have been right where she’s experiencing it.] C 11: Mhm. Mhm. Mhm. S 12: And, uh,  doomed to fail, not that I will die or  anything. I Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 24 think doomed to fail and to be there for my children  in a positive, cheerful,  warm, loving way.  And being a single parent, like I will be  their support system to a large extent.  And it scares me to think of their main support as being exhausted  and irritated  and  …  C 13: You just feel, “I may not be able to make it. I may be doomed  to failure by the very circumstances.” S 14: Right.    And talking about it this way I feel two ways: Like, “Oh c’mon Sylvia. Everybody else is doing it too.” And on the other hand, like, you’re willing to sit here and talk  about it with me  and I appreciate that.  C 14: Mhm. Mhm. But you don’t have to just tell yourself, “Oh, buck up, you can do it.” It’s, it gives you a good chance to really… S 15:  Right. Well, I do do that, “Buck up, you can do it.” I’ll do that plenty. But I don’t get much opportunity to,  to be sad with somebody about it.  How hard it  seems.  C 15: Yeah. Yeah. That’s the thing isn’t it? That to be all alone, with no support from anybody, it sounds like… S 16: Well, I mean  there are people that  care about me.  There’s, like, no financial  support.  And it’s not like I’ll have my mother next door,  or something like that. C 16: You’ll be alone with a heavy burden and it is a sad prospect really. S 17:   It feels sad.  And I get… Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 25 when I,  I depress myself by thinking, “Well, oh, sure I can give up my children.” And I think, “Well, I won’t do that.” Um, I’m seeing it as a black or white thing  and I know that’s not reality. C 17:  But it feels like reality. That either you’d have to give up your children or, or else  make a go of it. S 18: But then I also feel suspicious of myself. Like, “Well, Sylvia, you’re used to so much of getting your needs met.” Like, going out at night sometimes,  um, having friends,  and, and having a social life and not being overtired.  And then I see myself as pampered.  And, uh, if I just wasn’t so pampered,  things would be a lot better. C 18: That’s when you kind of scold yourself,  really. Mhm. Mhm. Mhm.  So that you really feel you’re gonna be hemmed in by that. I mean, your life is gonna be constricted  a good deal. A lot of the things you’ve been used to you just won’t have. S 19: And want for myself. C 19: And want for yourself.  Uh-huh. S 20: Yeah, that’s right. C 20: So really it does look like a very tough period, doesn’t it? S 21: Yep. It does.  But, I like being able to be sad and complain about how terrible I’m afraid it’s going to be then I can… like now I’m feeling like, and I’m excited too, you know, about facing it. C 21: Sort of a new phase of your life? Is it… it has excitement as well as dread in it, I guess. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 26 S 21:  Yeah about seeing what it will be like,  in fact.  . [Sylvia: I smiled  a little bit there and I think that I was feeling like a relief of tension or, um, I don’t know how to describe it but a relief of, of after crying and feeling sad and then having that feeling pass  then that satisfies that aspect of their experience and then they can move on to something else. So that it’s very common to have positive feelings, uh, follow, uh, very, uh, negative ones. Also I might just comment here that, uh, these pauses seemed very brief to me, uh, but to some therapists, to some counselors, uh, a pause is very hard to bear. I don’t find pauses hard to bear. This was her silence and I was willing to let her have it and to speak up when she was ready. During those pauses, I’m very quiet inside. Um, I really am quite content to wait. Uh, sometimes I am reviewing what she has been experiencing. Um, but I’m not, uh, I’m not trying to look ahead, and I’m not thinking about the process. I’m just trying to feel it as it might be going on in her.] C 21: It will be a new adventure but it’s one that, uh, you feel different ways about. S 22: Mhm. Yeah. So that’s, that’s what I think about the most, in terms of a problem area.  Like, the  way I started crying it seemed like I just couldn’t wait to get here and cry about it.  It was a little dramatic that way. C 22: ‘Cos it is…well, it is, it is a real sad prospect. And one, I guess, that you don’t let out too much to other people, the sad side of it. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 27 S 23: Right, I don’t do that  very well. I,  I am busy being strong  unconsciously. Or I’m also busy being depressed.   I’ve learned well. I believe being sad and scared are more dealing with  the problem. C 23: Mhm. Yeah being, being frightened of what you’re taking on and sad of what you’re losing for yourself.  Those are two very real  feelings. S 24: And I,  I also think that part of my fear and excitement is that I’ll be doing something different. Like, I’ve never worked  in, in my profession  and been like a confident,  single woman with young children  who are doing well.  And it’s like, um, that’s what I want for myself.   C 24: It’s a goal you’ve been working toward.  Mhm.  I wonder sort of how do your children feel about this? [Carl: Here I simply, um, followed my impulse because I found myself thinking about her children, I raised that question with her. Uh, whether that was a good move or not from a counseling point of view is, uh, hard to say until we see what happens next. You might think in viewing this that, uh, I had, uh, thought about what was going on and decided, “Here’s a, uh, here’s a piece that’s missing. Here’s something she hasn’t talked about.” Actually that’s not the process that goes on in me. Uh, I try to be open to whatever wells up in me and to say that, to, to act more, uh, from my inner feelings then from, from thinking about the process.] S 25: Well, my youngest son wants me to go work  so that we can have more  money and so that he can have more spending money. And, uh, my Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 28 oldest son has not, at this time, agreed to live with me yet.  But I’m preparing  with the hopes that he will at that time.  He is living with… he will be living with me the rest of the summer. C 25: Mhm. So that’s another new part of the… S 26: And my oldest son and I have a very strained relationship. He hasn’t been living with me the last two years. And so that’s gonna be another difficult part of what I’m talking about  is, um, at the same time needing and wanting to improve my relationship with Senate  and hoping there’ll be money for counseling. I’m hoping  that we can do work with a third party or in  a, uh, family group of some sort  because I believe that we’ll need help.  And, uh, so that’s, that, that part of the fall or the coming year scares me too about feeling so alienated from Senate. C 26: “Will he, will he really accept me as a mother?” [Sylvia: Well, he says, “Will he really accept as a mother” to me that is showing me he is listening to what I’m saying.  And that even, um,  I don’t know if it was or not at that time but it could be very easily have been a, a helper to me to help me focus with what I was, um, wrestling with in terms of understanding or clarifying for myself what I was thinking about it.] S 27:  As his mother,  as someone who loves him  and cares about him. C 27: So that’s a concern to ya, too. S 28:   Mhm. And can we get along? Can we live together? We haven’t lived together, and he’s lived in a very different lifestyle. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 29 C 28: “Can we really form a relationship of the kind that both of us would like?” S 29: Pardon? C 29: Your asking yourself, “Can we really form a relationship that both of us will like?” S 30:  Mhm. Yeah, and be happy and,  yeah…   That’s an important… I hadn’t thought of that on my own, but you mentioning my children  brings up the part about Senate, which is a very important part of what I think about.  And I’m happy I’ll have him with us  during the summer and we’ll be able to have time. C 30: You can get a start on that. Mhm. S 31: Mhm. Yeah.  When I’m not working,  for example.  Well, I felt awfully rigid about this upcoming filming.  I felt it in my body a lot. And I feel, I felt more relaxed since we started. C 31: Mhm. Mhm.  It’s a really difficult thing. S 32: Mhm.  Right, and just the same it’s exciting  to come  on this trip and to see you again  and it’s also frightening a lot.  Ya know, who’s gonna see it? And what are they gonna think?  And what’s it gonna look like?  Am I, am I being hard on myself or am I being good to myself? I don’t know - to put myself in this position  is what I mean. C 32: Yeah.  You have quite a little of conflict about, “Should I really be doing this? Who, who will see it?  What will they say? Am I wise?” S 33: Uh-huh. What’s it gonna be? What’s the finished project, gonna be?   Will I ever see it?    Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 30 [Sylvia: To put myself in a position, um, where I’ll be… I was disclosing very private things about myself where other people, I have no idea who all, may be viewing this and making their own judgments, and, um, exposing myself,  that seems hard and, uh, being good to myself, being willing to go through the hardness for the opportunity of learning and experience of Carl. That, I think, is being very good for myself.] [Carl: Sylvia has been quite aware of the filming but has had what I believe is a very good attitude toward it. Uh, that she hopes that by being as natural as she can in the interviews, she’ll be making a contribution to the counseling field. Both in the interviews a year ago and clearly in this interview, the relationship with me has been very important to Sylvia.] C 33:  Looks to me as though your eyes are saying something, but I don’t know what.  S 34: Well, I’m thinking about how moved I’ve been when I’ve heard your voice a few times over the past year.  And now I’m here. C 34: That made a… S 35: I wanna take it in –  being here. C 35: Mhm.  I guess you’re saying that I mean a good deal to you. S 36: Well, this time with you.  Yes, you, mhm.   I’m thinking about what I want to talk about or I’m feeling kind of empty right now about talking.  C 36: Can you tell me what I do mean to you? S 37:  Yes, I can.  Well,  I think the best Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 31 thing that I like to think about you is that as I understand your writings, I have not read very much that you’ve written, but that you have, that you live what you write about. And my understanding of a lot of popular writers are they write one thing and somehow they just don’t quite live that. They live something very different. And so I think of you as,  um,  wonderful in that way and not, uh…  C 37: But what does that mean to you? S 38:   Well that it’s what I would like to be more:  to have values and be able to, to do them  and to live them. C 38:  You’d like to have a good match between your life  and what you believe  and value. S 39:  And what I also sense about you is, uh, like “patience” isn’t the right word, but I see you as being comfortable with yourself so much so that whatever I or anyone else says or does, doesn’t  get you uptight. C 39:  S 40:  And maybe it does.  Sometimes it probably does ‘cause you’re a human being. C 40: It certainly does, that’s right. S 41: But it doesn’t seem like it does  too much. [Carl: I really was not quite accepting of her, uh, of her feeling that, uh, in the relationship I clearly was not uptight. It strikes me that what she’s saying here is, uh, practically a, uh, statement of the, uh, attitudes that, uh, we have found most effective in therapy. She’s saying that she experiences me as being genuine. Uh, she experiences me Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 32 as caring about her. Uh, and I think it’s quite clear that she feels that I understand her empathically. And those are the elements that, uh, both in experience and in research have shown up as being the most, uh, potent elements in a counseling relationship.] S 42: And I like that. I would like to be more present  and, and comfortable with myself so that other people, including my children and so forth and so on, could do what they do, and that I could be able to be a source of support and not be personally threatened  by this little thing and that little thing. C 42: And that, that has meaning to me. You’d like to be sufficiently accepting of yourself, that then you can be comfortable with what your children do or what other people do  and not, uh,  not feel frightened,  thrown off balance. S 43:  Mhm. And I’ve enjoyed through the year in the few letters that I’ve gotten from you, your warmth, and interest in me, in my life. I’ve liked that a lot from  you. And at the time those letters were written we had no plans to  make a movie  or all that stuff so that was really enjoyable.  Do you feel answered well? C 43: Yeah. Mhm. Mhm.  And I’m interested enough in you to know of any other things in your life that are important to you or that, uh, that are difficult for ya, or whatever. S 44:  Well, I’d like to go one of two ways. I don’t know which yet. Uh, one way would be back to the single working mother business. I’m not sure where we might go with that, but I know it’s a big thing for me. And another way Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 33 would be to go with the difficulty I see myself in having with my relationships with men.   I do so much analyzing  that I, I feel like throwing up my hands. “What’s the use of even talking about it?” But I… C 44: But you do have  difficulties in… S 45: Yeah. I’ll, I’ll go with the men.  And that’s the most frightening thing for me to talk about  on this film because people that I know will probably be seeing this  and men that I know.  I see myself, uh, and this, this is real scattered in my mind.  Scattered,  and looking every which way.  Well, I see myself making acquaintance with men, many men, I mean not just one man  and spending some time with that person. And then, um, feeling that they lost interest in me or that I turned them off. And I tell myself things like, “You can’t expect every man you meet to fall in love with you.”  And, um, let’s see,  what else?  Oh and then I’ll tell myself all these reasonable… “Of course this man doesn’t like me because I’m this and I’m that and.…” But, I don’t very often feel the disappointment and confusion about “Well I had a good time with that man.” And it seems to me like he must not have had a good time with me because I didn’t hear from him again, or I did and things went such and such a way. And, uh… C 45: Sounds like it seems kind of mysterious to you.  Why the men lose interest in you. S 46: Uh-huh. And then I have feedback from one person, one man friend of mine, who Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 34 says that I create, ya know I turn people off, men, myself. And so it’s like it’s all, it’s all my doing anyway.  But I have felt lately impotent about how to,  how to have a successful long rel- long lasting relationship with a man. Successful, I don’t mean perfect, I mean  workable.  And, uh, I think workable is successful  these days.  Yeah. C 46: Well, that’s a part of your life in which you just haven’t had the kind of, um, success that you wish you had had. Mhm. Mhm. An important lack in some way. S 47:  Now I’m remembering we talked about this before. C 47: A little bit. S 48: A little bit, right.   And I do that, the kind of analyzing that ‘”Well I have all these habits like, uh, I, um, I like to be by myself, I’m not real generous and outgoing  and taking care of, of people that I meet.” And the woman that I live with says that she doesn’t see me doing that at all like, “Oh come in I’ll fix you dinner, I’ll do this, I’ll do that.” Like I don’t do that.  And, and so I’m confused about do I need to do that to be in a close relationship? It doesn’t seem to me like I should  need to sell out to be um enjoyed and wanted. C 48: I gather what you mean by “selling out” is that if you, if you really put yourself out in kind of an artificial way, you don’t want that. Is that what you’re saying? [Carl: This is a good example of a client experiencing confusion. And, uh, she tries to be, to talk about it rationally. But it’s clear that what she is experiencing is just confusion itself. I feel this could have been a better response had I really heard her feeling that she Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 35 is powerless in, her, uh, relationships with men that she simply doesn’t have what it takes to build a workable relationship. I believe this feeling that, uh, “I have some fundamental lack in myself” is one of the commonest feelings that one meets in counseling situations. Almost all of us at times feel “there must be some terrible flaw in me or I wouldn’t have such problems in my life.”] S 49: Yes, if I do all these things for a man, so then he’ll want me. C 49: Mhm. Kind of buying his favor,  as it were. And you just don’t see yourself doing that. Don’t wanna do that. S 50: Or wanting to do it.   And then I… another question, hard question, I ask myself is, “Well, I’m choosing men to relate to that don’t know how to give in the way that I want to be given to.”  And then I try  to figure that one out.  “Oh simple, I’m choosing, that just means I need to choose differently.”  And then I look around and it doesn’t seem so simple. C 50: Mhm. You say you’re trying to analyze and analyze and analyze what, “what lack in me?” or “you know what lack in me?’ I guess your asking yourself mostly, “What lack in me keeps,  keeps me from having a lasting  relationship with men?” S 51: And one thing that now I’m recalling that really frightened me was I was talking- I lived with my husband for eight years  and I felt rejected by him and I left him.  And I left him for a man I was very much in love with that I’ve been very close to  for five years. But he’s also… like, I moved away from him but I felt left  by him also. And so this man friend of mine Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 36 said to me, “Well, what’s wrong with you that you can’t keep a man?” And that, uh, that really scared me inside because when I look at the situation in a practical, sensible way that doesn’t seem like reality.  But then I don’t know maybe it’s true. C 51: But that her saying that  he saying that,  uh, really does touch something in you. “Is there something wrong with me  that I….“ S 52: That I don’t see.  And, and, uh, just the fact that it touched me so much shows me that there’s something there. C 52: Mhm. It,  it wouldn’t bother you that much, or you wouldn’t think so much about it if there wasn’t something in you that that refers to. S 53: Mhm.  And I,  I see my mother that way a lot, that my mother not being able to have a successful relationship with a man and so that’s been my model and…  like, why can’t… C 53: You’re saying, “Maybe, maybe I’m just following the same pattern as my mother.” S 54: Mhm. Well, I am in that respect and I don’t like it.  And I’m not willing to do a bunch of crummy stuff that I…   So, right now  I’m living alone  and I’m not doing any crummy stuff.  And I also have some very nice relationships. It’s  those shades of black and white.  But I do feel a lot of confusion about building an intimate relationship.  A monogamous type  or primary… C 54: So you can have good times and all that, but still there is this nagging question or these nagging questions, “Am I just following my mother’s pattern?” “What is Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 37 wrong with me that I don’t have a permanent relationship with a man?” [Sylvia: I don’t ever recall feeling like Carl wasn’t understanding me or… because if I did have that feeling there was something I could do about it right then and there in terms of helping him to better understand me, so then I did feel understood. His intention was to very much to be with me and, uh, if I got the sense that he wasn’t that we could talk about that.] [Carl: I think this interview is a good example of the fact that, uh, when the relationship is good, the client is able to take more and more risks. Sylvia begins with material which is quite present in her awareness, and yet by the end of the interview she is dipping into material which she doesn’t understand, which she’s a little bit fearful of expressing. Uh, She has gone several levels deeper during the interview and to me that’s, uh, the mark of a process of therapy that in the long run will be successful. Perhaps through this whole interview, it’s evident that, uh, following the client’s experiencing, being a companion to the client in whatever, uh, is going on in her does lead to opening up new, uh, areas of concern, new explorations, leads her into new, uh, territories.] Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 4th Interview, page 38 This transcript is available for purposes of research, study and teaching.

Carl Rogers Demonstrates Client-Centered Therapy Transcription from the Video of the Film ""Struggle for Acceptance” Session 5 with Sylvia - 1975 [Source: Whiteley, J. M. . The struggle for self-acceptance.] [Commentaries are typed in brackets and italics to distinguish from the actual interview.] Carl Commentary 1: [This is my fifth interview with Sylvia. The fourth interview had been held on the previous day. Prior to that there had been the three interviews a year earlier. The interview will be shown as it was recorded, but with comments both from Sylvia and from myself at points where we felt we wished to clarify what was going on,uh, or to make some comment about what was going on.] Carl: Well, where would you like to start this morning? Sylvia1: Well, uh, I want to tell you about something that I've been thinking about and that’s it's a, a sharing more than  telling you a problem.  C Commentary 2: [So often clients and counselors get the feeling that, uh, the relationship is one which must be filled only with problems. Uh, Sylvia gives a little indication of that, this is just a sharing, it's not a problem.] S1 : And that is I’ve just recently noticed in myself that I've been learning.   And that's a big deal. Uh, I hear people say all the time, “Oh, I've learned so much, I learned this and I learned that and that was such a learning experience.” And I, all these years that I've been grown up, I haven't felt any learning, and I feel, “Well, what did you learn and how did you know that you learned it?” And it was a mystery to me.  And just the last few weeks, or actually I've been realizing in the last year mainly is that I’ve learned some things  and I know I've learned them and I, I know that, okay, that I'm at this point and with a certain situation or idea and that six months ago or three months ago it was different.  And so I'm feeling my learning and that's really exciting. C Commentary 3: [A relationship should be one in which good feelings have just as much place as bad feelings, and here she's bringing out some very positive feelings about Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 39 herself, which is a healthy and valid part of a counseling relationship. It's always exciting to me to, uh, hear a client telling of positive steps which, uh, he or she has been taking, and here Sylvia sounds confident as she's doing something that she has decided to do in her own way, not necessarily following all the books, but doing what she feels and experiences is right.]"
Client,1,": And it’s the awareness of it that's new.  That you're beginning to realize, “Hey, I am different in this respect,  I've learned something.” S2: I've changed.  And I can see the difference and feel the difference.  Yeah."
Client,2,": What are some of those differences? S3: Well,  um, I, I've made a decision to be more strict with my children  and to, uh, to listen to them but decide that I'm their mother and I know many things they don't, and that I will make many more decisions than  I've made in the past. And uhC3: M-hm, m-hm. Sounds as though you feel a bit stronger that way. S4: Yes. And and I've been trying it.  Trying being the more strict person and it's working beautifully.  Uh, they at first they, you know, have their little resistance or whatever it is but then we go on with the program, which is my program more,  and I feel a lot better about that as being uh uh helping children to adjust to the world."
Client,4,": I mean, sounds, sounds like you feel more like a grown-up mother. S5: M-hm. Capable.  Of making appropriate decisions.  For them. And another area is sex. And, uh, and I, I've done a lot of things in the past year, in the past mainly year that I haven't done before. That is, I've had intercourse with a few different men  and put myself in situations where before I was absolutely unwilling to do because of my fears and, and I've learned some things about myself. Like I know a lot more right now today about what kind of sexual relationship, what kind of intimate relationships that I want to have with men and that feels good.  Beca ... and, um, and it only came through, uh, risking I mean there was no, it only became through trying things out, there was no amount  There was no amount of, of therapy or reading or thinking or talking  that helped me to learn those things,  but it was feeling strong enough within myself that I can take chances."
Client,5,": So risking has been the road to learning  in the sexual area. S6: Uh-huh.  And it is with my children  and it is with relating to people in many ways, not just sexually.   Other ways too. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 40  C Commentary 4: [Sylvia is showing a lot of risking behavior. She's risking a good deal to talk about things like this on film. But what's more important is that she has come to the point in her own life where, where she realizes that her own experience is the best guide for her, not books, not therapy, not anything outside of herself. It is her own experience from which she can learn, and here she is learning in a very sensitive and, uh, personal area and is willing to share that with us.] S6 : Reaching out to people and approaching strangers and, uh ..."
Client,6,": Taking all kinds of risks that you hadn't before. S7: Some. More,  which, I mean I, I don't know about all kinds.  Quite a few, and it's been exciting  and hard."
Client,7,": And I guess that leads to a, uh, to a deeper kind of learning, or at any rate, a learning that you feel more sure of. I guess, I get a sense of assurance in what you're talking about. An assurance in you. C Commentary 5: [One thing that has been true with Sylvia in every interview we've had is that she thinks carefully about what she says, she thinks carefully about what I say, and when what I say is not correct, doesn't match her experience, she's quite willing to correct me. She is very precise in both describing her own feelings and also in making sure that my response to them is also accurate.] S8: Well, yes. Yes and no.  And I ... I ... feel more im... like I, I was saying before, I feel more immature and more and I'm more aware of my immaturity.  They're both, uh, a part of each other.  And uh, does that make, does that, I guess I'm thinking that it just sounds crazy."
Client,8,": No, I don't S9: To say that I feel more mature because I know I'm how, I know more about how immature I am."
Client,9,": Uh-huh. No, that makes a lot of sense to me. S Commentary 1: [I was surprised at what I said made sense to him. I think that I thought that it made sense to me, but that doesn't necessarily mean it would make sense to other people. I mean, it made in my own system of what was said. It felt good that he could understand me and he knew I that, that it made sense to him too.] C Commentary 6: [It's important to Sylvia to make sure that she's accurately understood. Can anyone understand how she can be more mature by being aware of her immaturity? Well, to me, that's quite understandable, but it's clear that she wants to make certain that Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 41 my understanding extends to that degree.] S10: It does."
Client,10,": Uh-huh. Because you’re, you're uh more aware of all aspects of yourself  and it sounds a more acceptant of them too. “Yes, I'm mature in certain ways  and here's some ways I know I'm immature.” S11: And I didn't know that before,  or I, I knew I felt uncomfortable that I didn't understand it.  But that's related to something I've been thinking about, I think, about being here with you and, uh, and telling myself two things.  One is, “Oh, you're just a, I'm just a dependent personality,” you know, Carl Rogers or blah-blah-blah-blah, don't, I don't run my own life.  I go for help a lot.  And then I tell myself I’ve always been so strong and so together and having everything so worked out in my head that I don't allow myself to, to be helpless in a situation where it might be  good for me.  Like right now here with you, I would like to be more helpless, which to me means open, I think.  To what to us and, uh, and I see myself being, uh, together and not being helpless.  S Commentary 2: [I think at that point I was feeling concern that I was just gonna go to another session of being all in control of things and and rattling on and on. I probably made a conscious decision that that I have to do something to, to break that and, uh, which was talk about it, talk about my fear. My fear was or concern that I wouldn't learn anything.]"
Client,11,": Sounds as though you, you voice that as a conflict, but it sounds as though really you're more on the, on the side of the second aspect that, uh, uh, to be open and, and in that sense helpless and vulnerable, I guess might be a possible term too, um, is something you, you really believe that's what you are, rather than that you're a totally dependent person and really helpless and have to, have to run for help. I sort of get the feeling you like this aspect of you that is able to be with me in a way that is, uh, more open, more vulnerable perhaps. S12: Well, I like it and I also scold myself for being dependent,  so there's"
Client,12,": There are the two sides, uh-huh. S13: there's something missing in the middle to connect,  and I it seems like you might have been talking about that and I still didn't hear it."
Client,13,":  M-hm.  So really to get it more accurately, you scold yourself for for being dependent, for, for wanting  to be here, for example, with me,  and yet at the same time you, you feel. uh, well, that's good, I, I really like that, but where's the, where's the integration of those two, uh, points of view.   Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 42 S Commentary 3: [That seemed to me like a very excellent, um, not paraphrase, but when he, you know, tells me back  what he thinks I meant, it, um, solidified what I expressed in the previous comment about that there was something missing. It made more sense to me.] S14: That's right.   May I hold your hands again?"
Client,14,: Sure. M-hm.  S15: To feel that old feeling.
Client,15,": Okay. S Commentary 4: [When we did that filming in A_____, we held each others' hands the whole time, and I imagine that it occurred me that it might be good to do that again. I feel good. At that time, I, I wanted to get away from being in my head so completely the whole time, experiencing.] C Commentary 7: [I felt very comfortable during this holding of hands. Uh, I'm reminded of a friend of mine who said that he did eye therapy and, uh, in a sense that's what this was. Our eyes were very much in contact, and, uh, I think as much was going on at a non-verbal way as in a verbal way. It was a close relationship, and we both experienced it that way.] S16:   I would like to be less, uh, less strong right now. I would like to give myself the gift of not having to be sensible  and reasonable and  Also the protection,  protect,  protect myself."
Client,16,": M-hm, m-hm, m-hm. Really would be giving yourself a gift if you could just kind of let go  and not, uh, not be so  competent  and able.    C Commentary 8: [It seems clear that the reason she wants to hold my hands is that she wants to experience something that is very frightening to her, namely to drop her competent, reasonable, strong self and let herself be some of the weakness and vulnerability that she is.] S17: And I think it helps to touch   you, to, to, to let go of the shoulds, of my"
Client,17,": M-hm, m-hm. And you feel some contact and maybe you can say, “Well, maybe I don't have to be so strong, so  Maybe I can just let go more.” S18:  Yes.    I Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 43 want to get away from all, um, my rationalizing right now this minute, and I don't know how to do that  except to shut up.   And,  so it's not like I have so much a desire to sit and not talk and look in your eyes as I have a desire to not be the way I am all the time.  And I don't know yet  what else to do.  C Commentary 9: [In the interviews that we held a year ago, the silences were very long and Sylvia found a, a great deal of security and, uh, seemed to profit a great deal from holding my hands during the interview, and here she, uh, returns to the pattern of a year ago. It's another indication of the fact that these interviews with her perhaps rest more solidly on just the fact of the relationship than they do even on the content of what, uh, she's saying and talking about.]"
Client,18,": Have to be kind of silent, to let go of that rational and rationalizing part of you. S19: M-hm.  It feels easier to focus on, uh, in this position that I'm in now with you I feel more focused,   yeah."
Client,19,": Are there any things that sort of come bubbling up? S20: Yeah, I know it's something I want to talk about."
Client,20,": Okay. M-hm.   But it's not easy, huh. S21: No, it's not easy and I'm enjoying the richness of feeling  your hands this way and letting go of some more of, of the camera business  and the ...  And, uh, and the fear about bringing up something that   and knowing that in about fifteen minutes it'll all seem, um,  I don't know not quite as serious.  S Commentary 5: [It just had to take its own time for me to get to where I could feel like I could say the words that I needed to say. It was almost like waiting and just like, uh, you know, what else is new while I'm waiting? For something that took a natural process that it had to take.] C Commentary 10: [If anyone has a doubt about the value of silences, it should be removed by this interchange. Sylvia's saying, “I'm doing more work when I'm silent than I am when I'm talking.”] S Commentary 6: [His specific comments or the content of his comments is not necessarily helpful as opposed to not helpful, but what it does do that is valuable is that it gives me something to bounce against. It's a stimulation to better focus myself.] S21 : There's something I've been wanting to talk over with you. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 44"
Client,21,": Okay. S22: Good. I'm real attracted to black people.  And, uh, that's about the craziest part of me, um, I'm ashamed  Um, I'm embarrassed, not right now this minute, but when I'm out walking around.   And living my life."
Client,22,": You feel what an awful thing it is that I'm attracted to black people.  C Commentary 11: [I think that from the time that she first wanted to hold my hands, I felt that she probably was going to make use of that closer relationship to get to something that she hadn't been able to express before, and now she's taking really a great risk in talking about something very private, very personal.] S23: Not, and not all the black people I see  but a lot.  And, uh, like the black people that I talked it over with, it seems, it doesn't seem like any problem at all, they understand perfectly.  And, but my family, I think it's a real painful situation for them when I have as many black friends as I do.  AndC23: That sounds like not only your family looks down on it or something but that you scold yourself for it too. S24: Uh-huh, right. I, I think there's something wrong with me."
Client,24,": Yeah, that's it. S25: Um. But it doesn'tC25: “What kind of a crazy person am I that I feel attracted  to so many blacks?” S26: Sick, sick I think of it as"
Client,26,": Sick, that's S27: and ne... neurotic, um.  Strange."
Client,27,": You really feel that there's something sick in you that causes you to have so many black friends. S28:  Well, I keep looking for a reasonable explanation  and there is none."
Client,28,": So there isn't any reason except that you feel that way. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 45 S29: M-hm. And I ..."
Client,29,": And that isn't good enough. S30: Well, I, I, I've been struggling so long to accept that in myself and I'm still fighting. It's like I'm fighting to accept that in myself and, and letting go rather than thinking it's a terrible thing  and and that I can't let other people know.  And, uh,"
Client,30,": You feel “I should not feel that way. I shouldn't be that way. Sick.” C Commentary 12: [I think by that response I was trying to exaggerate her feelings in order to assist her in, uh, becoming more accepting of them, but as I, uh, listen to it I think I might have responded more powerfully by responding to her struggle to accept herself as a person who is attracted to blacks.] S31: Like when I, wh ... , I imagine when I meet a black person that I am attracted to, that that person will know   and I always wonder if they can tell."
Client,31,": Mm, see if it shows.  M-hm, m-hm. S32: And that they'll think I'm strange.  M-hm. And it has something to do with all the black/white sex stuff that goes on, like, um, black women and white men which is very foreign to me, I have very little thinking or, um, concern about that. But the black men/white women thing,  um. and I'm attracted to a lot of black men.  Yeah."
Client,32,": It has something to do with the sexual attraction. S33: I know, yeah, it does, I know it does.  But it's not just that, it's also  children and and women and lifestyle  and as I see it through my tunnel vision, which I do."
Client,33,": So I guess you're saying, um, yeah, there's a sexual element in it but I'm also attracted to their way of living. S34: M-hm. That I see.  And I, but I think what I see isn't what is."
Client,34,":  That's partly your fantasy or something.   S35: Maybe putting that, that, this on this film will help me that  stand on the ground and be who I am.  And not be so ashamed, so embarrassed and so,  um, uncomfortable. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 46"
Client,35,": In a way you're saying it out loud and really in a wa ..., in a sense, publicly, may help you to feel “I don't need to be so ashamed of that.”  C Commentary 13: [I've filmed a number of interviews, but I never had a client knowingly make use of the filming to try to gain more acceptance of self and clearly that's what Sylvia is doing in this interchange. By putting herself clearly on record, she feels perhaps then she will feel less ashamed, less sick, more, uh, truly acceptant of the person that she is and the experiences that she has.] S36: And I tell myself I should be joyful, I mean,   why, why negative?  And I, I guess, you know, the culture or I don't know, I"
Client,36,": But you feel disapproved of probably, certainly by your family and maybe by the culture in this respect. S37: My friends don't understand.  My white friends."
Client,37,": M-hm, m-hm.   Makes you feel different.  Set apart or something like that.  S38: Well, sometimes I feel different but I know a lot of other people, I believe a lot of other people feel the same way.  and I know a lot of other white women are attracted to black men. So I believe that's common."
Client,38,": So that somehow you know you're not alone in this. C Commentary 14: [Here's another example of the fact that expressing all the negative attitudes she has toward her own attraction to blacks leads her to realize this really is not so bad after all; there are positive sides of it. Other people, other women feel the same way.] S39: But it seems like the strength of my feelings and, uh, the on-goingness and my de ..., my desire to identify with the black culture and,  um, is. is what seems out of proportion to me. That I feel out of proportion about it."
Client,39,": M-hm. So Okay, other women feel the same way but not to the degree that you do, you think.  That's kind of out of  Out of scale. S40: Or in general to the degree too, not just man/woman, but  people.  Maybe I,  it'll come a time accepting that part of myself."
Client,40,": Maybe someday you won't be ashamed of yourself for that. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 47 S41: M-hm. Maybe someday I can be proud of myself.  And for what I believe and feel.  And I'm gradually learning to do that."
Client,41,": Uh-huh, m-hm. So, perhaps what you are and what you feel will be something you can take real satisfaction in instead of feeling  how shameful. S42: M-hm. And to me it's it's a sign of my growth is being able to do what I'm doing with you now, you'll make a film.    It's a real brazen thing to do.  M-hm."
Client,42,": Feel this is a risk.  And that's a sign of learning and of growth. S43: M-hm. Well, also it somehow it's a little different from a risk in the sense of some of my friends say, “A film? Wh... What do you want to do that for?” I mean, there's suspiciousness about it and …"
Client,43,": M-hm, m-hm.  So that's seen as another strange part of you. S44: Well, not so much, I mean, that's not a"
Client,44,": Not so. S45: It doesn't bother me.   Sometimes I, well, right now  sometimes, I have the sense of talking away what we were talking about and I'm wondering, if I went away, if I withdraw from the subject, uh, what's your perspective? It seems like we were talking about my attraction to black people and now we're not. And I'm, I don't know, like did we finish talking about it or did I withdraw? S Commentary 7: [My sense is that I was feeling confused about what was going on.] C Commentary 15:[I think this is a sample of Sylvia's sharp awareness of her own experiencing. I don't believe that in content we had left the subject of her attraction to blacks. But she realizes in herself that somehow she has withdrawn from that. She's, as she says, talked away from it. Obviously, that's because it has been a, a frightening subject to her. Perhaps also because she feels she's gone as far as she can go with it at the present time.] S45 : Um"
Client,45,": It's more of your analyzing it, isn't it, trying to think  about what's happening. “Did I run away from it? Or was I finished with it?”  Or continue think about it S46: analyze it  Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 48"
Client,46,": Instead of asking, “Do I feel as though I'm finished with it?  Do I feel as though I'm escaping from it?” S47: I like that. I like your your questions, or comments.  Do I feel finished?  No, I don't, I don't feel, I don't know  about escaping  and feeling finished, it's"
Client,47,": The feeling is one of uncertainty. S48: M-hm.   Well I I feel like I want to go back and listen to what we just talked about,  that I didn't hear it very well.  And ... C Commentary 16: [This is one of the commonest experiences when a person delves into areas that are sensitive, where they've exposed themselves in, in ways that make them very vulnerable. Sylvia, like many other clients, hardly knows what she has said because it has come so close to her inner feelings, because it’s such a delicate experience. Incidentally, this is one point where a wrong response on the part of the counselor can be very frightening and very threatening because her inner self is really very exposed at this point. This inability to remember is the, uh, defense of the self against being changed too rapidly. It probably would be very good for her to hear this later and to begin to accept more fully what she's just been expressing.]"
Client,48,": “What did I say? What did I feel?” You'd like to have a rerun of it and it S49: M-hm. Like I just went jabber-jabber-jabber-jabber.  And all that.  And soC49: Sounds like you scold yourself for that, as though, “Oh, I just talk talk-talk.”   It didn't sound like just talk-talk-talk to me. S50: It didn't?"
Client,50,": No. C Commentary 17: [Throughout these interviews, my own feelings have been largely empathic and caring ones. Here's the first time that I express some other feeling of my own. I simply couldn't permit her to scold herself for what she's been doing, and so I said, “It doesn't sound like, uh, just talk-talk-talk to me,” which was a very real feeling on my part at that moment.] S Commentary 8: [At that time I had the feeling that Carl was really asking me something that he wanted to know. Like genuinely interested and concerned about that.] S51:  Well, I would like to hear it again,  and it has, it, Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 49 and slowed down somehow,  and I now  I could think like taking your hand and looking at you and slowing down.  And then when I'm slowing--and that's what I want to do ...  But while I'm doing it, I'm scolding myself. “What are you doing this for?”"
Client,51,": M-hm.  Let me give you a very brief rerun of part of it. You were saying, “I'm ashamed of myself for being attracted to black men. Uh, I know many other women have some of the same feeling, but it seems to me I have that feeling disproportionately strong and uh my family is critical of that, the culture is critical. Um, I'd like to be able to accept those feelings in myself. Maybe I'm making a little bit of progress along that line, but still it does seem a need to be a a strange part of me that I don't understand.”   S52: That's right."
Client,52,": “And part of that attraction is sexual but I'm also attracted to their children, to the way they live, to a lot of things about them.”  C Commentary 18: [Sometimes when I show what an accurate listener I am, I feel proud of myself and I do in this moment.] S53: And what I, what you said that strikes me the most is it’s the part of me I don't understand,  it's a part of me I don't understand."
Client,53,": It just is, but you can't quite uh can't quite get at the reasons for it. You have to have the reasons. S54:   And I don't know why I have to have the reasons,  I don't have to explain to anybody.  So it seems like I don't have to have a reason."
Client,54,": M-hm.  So maybe the intellectual understanding isn't as important as you thought it was. S55: I think the acceptance is what's most important,  my acceptance.  C Commentary 19: [As she has shown throughout the, uh, interview, as she says, she analyzes and analyzes. She has to see the reasons for all of her behavior, and now she's taking a little bit lighter look at that, and realizing, ""I don't have to have a reason for every bit of my behavior, I don't have to understand all of it. I can simply accept it. Perhaps I can simply accept it."" I admire Sylvia's courage in being willing to voice the very, uh, intimate feelings she has on film. I believe that both the expression of those feelings will be constructive for her and that the willingness to share them with a wider audience will also have a positive effect in her life.] Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 50"
Client,55,": “If I could accept it, I wouldn't have to understand in the sense of knowing the reasons.” S56:  Or explain to anybody.   M-hm."
Client,56,": Sounds like that's what you're doing in imagination a lot, trying to explain it to somebody. S57: M-hm.  It seems like I'll probably never understand it.  So I can make life a lot easier for myself by not trying."
Client,57,": M-hm.  It may be one of those things that if you can accept it, you wouldn't need to have all the explanations.  S58: Wonder what  what keeps me, um, feeling like I need to justify myself.  Like that's a more basic"
Client,58,": M-hm. It's a broader statement of it. S59: than about a particular view, accepting myself about this and about that."
Client,59,": M-hm. You would in general feel “I have to justify myself with proper reasons.” S60: M-hm.   Well, do you do that? Do you"
Client,60,": I suspect we all do, some.  M-hm. S61: So there's nobody that just  floats along on their  intuition. That’s not it either. So what I need is more balance really.  Not that I’m wrong to justify it, but that I can be more, justify it less and feel more,   and feel comfortable.  S Commentary 9: [This experience that I had with Carl is, uh, real special to me and, uh, one of the things about it that feels real close to me is the emotional safety I felt with him. That there was somehow a, a boundary or a fence or a something that, uh, separated the space that I was in with Carl from the rest of the world and inside that space I was very safe and I would not be hurt. I didn't have to have any fear that I would be hurt no matter what I said or did, and the focus of my thinking was how very safe that felt. Another thing I felt from him that I think has affected me some over this time is that I felt, uh, like support from him to be myself, to listen to myself and to respond to myself and to care about, to put myself first. I think about how my life might have been changed by my experiences with Carl. I think Carl's caring for me in the way that he did, his, uh, modeling, helping me to learn to care for myself, where like maybe my most important resource would be myself.  So it seems to me that in his style of relating there's a lot of support to do that, a lot of encouragement and influence to listen to Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 51 myself.] END OF SESSION Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Sylvia, 5th Interview, page 52 This transcript is available for purposes of research, study and teaching. It may not be sold. Kathy Interview by Carl Rogers  [Source: Shostrom, E. L. . Three approaches to psychotherapy II [Film]. Orange, CA.] Rogers: I want to meet this client as a person. And I want our encounter to be that of two persons. I have no desire to have advance information regarding her. I'll work with whatever she wishes to reveal of herself. It's my hope that I can first of all be myself. Be present. Be real in the relationship. I usually find it easy, also, to feel a caring for the client. But I can't predict in advance whether I will feel that. I would like to let myself enter into her inner world of feelings and perceptions as accurately and as sensitively as I can. In order to experience that kind of empathy, I'11 need to lay aside, as far as possible, my own biases and preconceptions. The extent to which I can do that will to a considerable degree determine the progress which she is able to make in the time we have together. I feel I'm a responsible therapist. I'm responsible for doing my best to create a facilitative climate in which she can explore her feelings in the way that she desires, move toward the goals that she wishes to achieve. It's in this deep sense that my approach to therapy is centered in the client. Aiming to empower him or her to search out and experience the areas of conflict or pain, to perceive self in new ways, to choose to follow new options in behavior. It is my own self I find feelings other than those of caring and of understanding I'll feel free to express these; but as my own feelings, not as any judgment of or guide for the client. Or, especially on a first interview, I may have no other feelings than a prizing of the client and a desire to in-dwell in her experience. There's no way I can tell in advance. For me each encounter with a client is fresh, unpredictable, often enriching to my learning as well as hopefully, enriching the self-learning of the client. So I look forward with eagerness to whatever our time together may bring.

Throughout this interview the responses of the therapist  , and the client  are numbered for easy reference. Carl Rogers’ Interview with Kathy -- 1977 T: Hi, Kathy. C: Hi, Dr. Rogers. T: I'm really glad to meet you. C: Thank you. T: And… I don't know whether you're feeling a little uptight under these lights and all, but I think I'm feeling a little uptight, but I don't think that will last very long. And I have, not having met you before I, I don't have any idea what sort of concerns or issues you want to bring up, but I'd be glad to hear whatever you want to say."
Client,1,: I'm not quite sure where to begin.
Client,2,": But, uh, some of my concerns are, um, I've become very much aware since my husband was killed last December, um, my own feelings of aloneness."
Client,3,": And I don't think it’s directly related to his death because we had been separated for about four years before he was killed. And I, I became aware that, after he died especially, that he was really very important in my life. I was kind of using him as a shield against going out and having other relationships. And now he’s gone and I can't use that anymore. And I feel very, very frightened of new male relationships. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 54"
Client,4,": Right, right. Definitely, I didn't have him. I didn't have that to hide behind anymore. And, uh, I had a tremendous feeling of loss when he died because I did care for him. But, um, in going out with other men lately, I just have this feeling of, uh, it's very strange. I'm very uncomfortable."
Client,5,": Yes. For a long time I didn't feel like going out and that was fine. I was going through my loss of him, but that was all right. I didn’t push it or anything. But just recently I started going out and I've been aware for years of how lonely, I have been very, very lonely. I haven't been dating very much for the last four years, mostly just working and taking care of the kids. And um, I think I'm keeping myself in kind of a no-win situation where I'm really lonely. And yet it's kind of like I'm keeping myself there because I've got a guard around me, and I'd kind of like to break out of that."
Client,6,": Yes, I know that. I'm very… I am."
Client,7,: Part of me does.
Client,8,": Part of me says, “No way”."
Client,9,": I, I can almost, well I was going to say I can almost go back to the point where I really built up that safeguard in me when my marriage was going bad. Over five years ago and I could feel myself, and I know I did, I withdrew and I’ve been withdrawn ever since. It's kind of like, “No more. I don't want any more hurt.” So…"
Client,10,": Uhm, hmm. See, and I've been aware of this for a long time too, but I never go beyond the awareness level."
Client,11,": That's right, that's right. How can one stay safe and still be open?"
Client,12,": I don't, I really don’t. If I did, maybe I probably would have done it a long time ago, but I don't."
Client,13,": I, I think I'm a pretty open person to begin with. And uh, everything is fine in a relationship as long as the focus does not turn onto me."
Client,14,": That's right. And the focus on me up to a certain level, but not in the romantic kind of a way. A friendship, I would value that."
Client,15,": But you know, that's important though, because um, if a person doesn't want to really be your friend, how can you have them for a lover?"
Client,16,: No way.
Client,17,: It is for me.
Client,18,: We've gotten to the point where I won't go beyond.
Client,19,: I've laid the cards out and that's all I want to play.
Client,20,: That's right.
Client,21,": Yes, it is."
Client,22,": So here I am.  I feel like saying to myself, “Well you got this far. It's not so bad.”  It's all right; I make the best out of it."
Client,23,": Yeah, right."
Client,24,": Yeah, make a joke. Talk about something else."
Client,25,": See, but that's it. I made a bargain with myself. There's two parts: the part that understands and it’s all right, and the other part that's scared silly. But the part that understands isn’t going to force the part that's scared. When it’s safe enough, I'll be kind to myself."
Client,26,": When the scared part feels ready. It’s as if part of me is in a cave away from the rest of the world. But it cert-, I certainly can't come out of that cave, unless I know that it’s all right, that there won't be a lot of pain to greet me. What's the sense in coming out? So it’s up to the best of me to make sure that there are nurturing people around me."
Client,27,": That's right. That's why, that's why I value the friendships with men and with other people. I don't care for the rest. Not to say that I don't need it, I do, but I need the friendship, and the safety and the security of that first. I, um, took a trip not too long ago and I met a man that I had known years and years ago, only very briefly. And I met him again I went out with him. And he was such a lovely person, such a kind person, and a very ... a very good person. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 57 Anyway, it was in the mountains and as I was driving home from his, um, his home, looking at the mountains, I, I had this feeling. It’s kind of funny, I haven't read the Carlos Castaneda books, but I know the concept of the third eye. And I was feeling as I was driving through those mountains that, “Now it’s all right for my third eye to come out, and to be able to perceive.” And I felt so good. But when I came back home, I've kind of busied myself with woodworking, and the house, and that kind of thing. And I'm kind of back in the same environment, in the same predicament. But I know that I, I consciously at times choose between focusing in on things and not."
Client,28,: When I was driving.
Client,29,": I could perceive, it doesn’t have much to, it did have to do with him, but I could perceive myself, and my closed-offedness. And at that time I was open, and I had that perception of myself and that awareness that I had been closed. And that, when I was driving through that canyon I was feeling very open and now I could have my understanding, and it was a1l right."
Client,30,": Yeah, yes, it was great. And then he came to see me. He flew in to see me a couple of weeks ago. And um, I felt, see I was aware I had this memory of that opening up and so I felt more guarded."
Client,31,": But kind of slowly unpeeling layers, or slowing coming up."
Client,32,": Too, yeah that's right, that's right."
Client,33,: That's right.
Client,34,": I think my most tender part.  Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 58"
Client,35,: My most tender part.
Client,36,":  I, for a long, long time, I’ve had the feeling of hopelessness of ever coming out. And do you know life is an existence without all of you…"
Client,37,: …all of you.
Client,38,: Right.
Client,39,: That's right.
Client,40,": That's right, it's just doing things, just doing things. The part that, you know, that I consciously avoid are the arts. The things that I love, music, theater, paintings, that kind of thing."
Client,41,: I don’t get to the core.
Client,42,: That's right.
Client,43,:  I’ve reached another stop.
Client,44,":  I have to give equal time to all of my dimensions. We just have, I just felt, you know, in touch with my vulnerability, but now I’m feeling angry."
Client,45,": Like, “It’s none of your business…”"
Client,46,: …what I'm feeling.
Client,47,": That’s right, that’s right. What do you want to do that for?"
Client,48,: You've got other things to do.
Client,49,: That's the part that keeps me lonely.
Client,50,": It's like I don't really trust that I can trust you to know that. I can tell this and that. You may feel a little something about it, but what then? You know, I mean you know, “It's a nice story, so, big deal, something else to do”."
Client,51,: That's right.
Client,52,: You know…
Client,53,":  I want to make a joke and say, ""Aw, go on.""  You know, um, I'm a nurse and, a psychiatric nurse, worked in a psychiatric hospital last year. One of the big things there, the patients got a lot of points if they would talk in group. I mean everybody wants you to talk. You know, Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 60 the good patient talks. And I thought, you know, anybody can talk. The reason why people don’t talk is not because they can’t talk, it’s because they don't know how people are going to respond. That's where it’s at. So I don’t think the patients were not being good patients. I don't think they were being bad patients because they weren't talking. I think that the staff should have a demerit for not responding. Ok, these patients talked, now how do you respond? Makes it a whole new ballgame."
Client,54,": And so now, I talked."
Client,55,": Yeah now I earned my points, that's true. But, um, I think that’s the fear of everyone. It’s not so much revealing themselves, but being cared about. That's my fear. That's my fears after I've revealed myself, “Who cares?”"
Client,56,": My husband used to say he cared, but it was just words, it was words. He um, I think he cared as much as he could care but, he had so many conflicts inside of himself that he didn't even see me as a person. Didn't even see me. It's not that he didn't want to care. It's that he couldn't, he was too busy with himself. But I understand that. And I understand that with other people, too. But see I just can’t go around revealing myself all the time to people who are just too busy with themselves."
Client,57,": That's it, not to someone who’ll say, ""Oh, well, Kathy, I really care,"" and then I don't see them for a couple of years. Or, ""I'll call you"" and then they never call. You know, when I first split up from my husband, I would go to these different functions, not with a date, but with friends, and meet a man and he'd say, ""I'll call you"". And for a while there I'd be sure that I wasn't home, because I couldn't stand to know if he didn't call. And that way I didn't know if he didn't call, so there was a possibility that he had called. But I wasn't home, so how could I know. So with that, that, that vulnerable I was really in touch with it."
Client,58,": That's right, caring people, will call you, or drop by, “How's it going?”, that Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 61 kind of thing."
Client,59,": No, it would be enough, if they would do that.  That'd be just great, that would be just great. I don't think I really want that much from another person. The morsels are fine, but I'm not even getting the morsels."
Client,60,": Yeah, I mean I could work up to it all right. That's why I think with this friend it was nice. And may have gone back in but I felt myself, come alive a little bit. A little bit of magic had come into my life, and that was nice. And I'd rather not come out all at once and run back in. I'd rather come out bit-bybit and stay out. But see the thing of it is that, and like we're talking now, a little bit, or I'm thinking about the focus of the relationship, it has to be this male-female kind of thing. And, um, I don't think that what I need to do is to come out and have love, and then, think about a male-female relationship. But I don't know how I can come out too much without a man ."
Client,61,: That's right. It must be a man. Or…
Client,62,": It must be a man, that’s right, because that's where my fear is."
Client,63,": I'd like to have a caring relationship. And its kind of funny, it's like a little girl wanting a man to take her out of the cave, and, care about. I'll put it back on me, I feel like a little girl. Someone to care about me and to know that I'm comfortable and that I'm all right, and then ask for himself."
Client,64,": For himself, of the relationship."
Client,65,":  The little girl is the non-sexual, being. That's right, “Don't use me Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 62 sexually first. And then if you like it good enough, keep coming back.” That's what I don't want."
Client,66,": That's right, and can respond as a woman, if the other is there."
Client,67,": I'm confused, do I tell one man that, or is that what I…"
Client,68,": Oh, this individual."
Client,69,": Oh, I think I could tell him that, I know I could. But you know, I start putting him down.  I know that's just, my sister told me, she said, “That's just because you're scared.” Because I told her the kind of man I would, I thought I would be comfortable with, and he is this kind of person. And then I start telling her all these bad things. And she said, ""Nobody would be perfect. You would do this with anyone, some."" But with this person I think I could."
Client,70,": I'd like to be able to carry that over. I suppose maybe, maybe I'm glossing that over or something, but I'd like to carry it over in my relationships with everyone. To get what I need from the relationship, and not focusing in on the other person. See, I think the way I am I'm the perfect nurse, the perf-, you know, anything for somebody else. And that's fine, focus in on them any time. But on myself, like I'm too scared to do that. Like that's a no-no. But I'd like to be able to do that, focus in on my own needs, first. But I feel kind of selfish when I look at it that way. I fee1 like a taker instead of a giver and that's got a negative, connotation."
Client,71,": “Wait a minute, you're the nurse. What is this?”"
Client,72,": That's right. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 63"
Client,73,: Seems awful.
Client,74,": “You're so naughty, just thinking about it.”"
Client,75,: Yeah.
Client,76,": I feel wicked, but I enjoy it. I'm enjoying thinking about it."
Client,77,": It's really a lovely fantasy to be completely narcissist, completely selfcentered, and into pleasure, and into comfort."
Client,78,": But in a way, you know, in a way I am being good to myself by keep that vulnerable part of me away until it's safe. Because not everybody would be good to you, not everybody would be kind. There are people who would use you up, and not bat an eyelash, and not even think about it."
Client,79,: That's right.
Client,80,": I was just smiling, I was thinking, but I care."
Client,81,": Uhm, hmm. I do care."
Client,82,": I like caring. I like it. I like caring for myself, and not giving away every part of my, just because some Tom, Dick, or Harry wants it."
Client,83,": That's right. It's nice to have that feeling of caring for myself, that's good. But you know since Dick died, I was thinking, I could die tomorrow. Any of us could, and, I'm missing, I want to have more. I don't want to just care for myself, I want to, I want to be able to care for myself and at the same time be able to take in life more. But I'm not doing, see I've closed it off, if I could figure out some way of doing that, then, you're smiling , so that'd be just great."
Client,84,": That's right, I want, I saw a card one time that said, “Born, and then died.” And you open it up and it says, ""In between, he lived"" or something like that. That's what I would like for myself, a little life in between the born and the death, a little more life, and pleasure. See that's what I'm missing. Deep down inside is the, pleasure, experience of pleasure and joy, those kinds of experiences. I've been happy. I have fun. I do enjoy my children, but it's on a limited level."
Client,85,": But joy is on a deeper level, you see, so… I want to say, ""But how've you been lately?"" ."
Client,86,": Yes, “How's your wife, your house?” all that."
Client,87,": It would, yes."
Client,88,: Well let’s just have a rest for a while.
Client,89,": Oh, thank you. I was thinking my humor comes to the rescue, “Give me a breather.”"
Client,90,": That's right; I had a dream one time. And I dreamed that I was on a sled with two other girls, and we were going down a snowy hill. And we were going Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Kathy Interview, page 65 too fast. And I told them to stop, they had to get off, otherwise they were going to crash into this train station at the bottom of the hill. And they wouldn't believe me. So I got off, and they went on. And I side-stepped in the snow all the way down the hill, but there were lots of trees where I was side stepping, and I was hanging onto the trees, one by one as I went down. And when I got to the bottom of the hill, the sled had crashed, or something. And then I thought to myself, “That means, that has to do with me. Part of me would go too fast, and…”"
Client,91,: That must be it.
Client,2,": Uh, I don't know. I wa ... I was thinking that when we ... when we talked earlier about the, the anger ...  I've been thinking a great deal about that."
Client,3,": Right, you know, and I'm not sure that, uh, that I really don't want to be angry, you know, and I'm not sure if anger ... being angry now, is a part of the process and I've got to do that, but I'd like to ... I guess my uh ... I guess my mind uh academically or something, you know, and something other than emotion or whatever, like, would like to tell me that, uh, I'd like to uh ... to not be angry and to skip over that part, if that's a part of the process, you know? But I'm not sure I can do that , you know."
Client,4,": For sure. It almost seems like that ... that uh whatever is happening in my environment or whatever happened in my environment is pulling me into again uh, that kind of a trap ... that kind of a system that I don't particularly care ... er, er, you know, if you know what I mean."
Client,5,: Right.
Client,6,: For sure. For sure.
Client,7,": Right. It's ... it's almost like in this country ... and, and I've always felt like this ... you only have about two options, you know, when you deal with race ... you either have to be ... you're either a racist or you're an anti-racist.  And that doesn't really seem to be the kind of thing that I'm, you know .... I don't really care to be an anti-racist, if you know what I mean  anymore. Uh, and I don't wanna be a reflection of any other ... of any other larger society at all.  I really don't want to ..."
Client,8,: For sure.
Client,9,": For sure. I think that I could probably trust that a lot better than, than, than trusting what's happening or what has happened.  And, um, and when I think about that ... when I think about all of that, you know, uh, the things that we talked about ... I, I, I think that, um, that's worse than the leukemia."
Client,10,": You know? I know that may sound very strange or whatever, but a lot of things have been strange"
Client,11,": You know, since this time; and, and what has happened to me didn't just start when I found out that I, you know, was going to die.  Kind of thing."
Client,12,": I think so.  I think so. And to some extent that ... that would ... that is mild ... like, for instance, you know, you ... I don't know what would have happened if I had died or if I will or whatever, but I certainly know what's happening now and what happened. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 86"
Client,13,: You see.
Client,14,": And to some extent that ... that kind of leukemia, that kind of deterioration of the body is the same kind of thing that happened to my mind.  And um ...  You know, it’s ..."
Client,15,": Yeah. I, I, I, I really ... I think, I really want to say that and I really want to, um, and I believe it, you know, and I guess that part of me that's, that's my culture or is a part of the total, ... is saying that it's not all that good to be angry, you know, because militancy is frowned upon or whatever, you know.  And I guess I'm using mili- militant in my sense because of ... it's, it's just traditionally, you know, when blacks become angry they're, they're not angry ... they're militant.  You know what I mean ?"
Client,16,": Mmm. For sure, for sure, for sure. Yeah. And I ... and there's nobody that I can put my finger on, you know ... that person that started the whole thing ... that process, you know, because that would probably be a lot better for me, you know, then I probably would, would try to, to do ... to do that person in."
Client,17,": Mmm. But how, you know ... but how do you blame somebody else who's sick?  You know? And I think that people that do that to other people, or at least - when it was done to me, um ... they're really sick, you know. And here I am, you know, trying to ... you know, I don't know if it was forgiving, I don't know if I'm sounding confused or whatever, maybe, you know, but trying to accept their sickness, you know."
Client,18,": And at the same time, you know, I really haven't had the opportunity of letting anybody accept mine."
Client,19,": Or maybe I haven't given it to them, but ... Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 87"
Client,20,: Right.
Client,21,": Yeah , for sure. I don't know really, you know. Maybe I'll just be angry one day  and maybe I'll really feel better or whatever, you know, and, and I ... when I, when I smile, I ... I'm uh, you know, I'm smiling but there’s a lot of ... and I'm sure you know that ... there's a lot of anger there.  You know, but it's not my nature to be angry  It's not my nature to be angry, but I feel angry."
Client,22,": For sure , for sure. And to try to be angry in a productive ... I don't know how you'd be angry in a productive way ... you know, in terms of ... It's like now when I ... when I respond to people, you know ... if, if when you encounter people, you know, whether it's in the street, whether it's in a professional situation or whatever, you know ...if people send out certain messages and wh ... no matter what they're saying or whatever ... there are certain kinds of messages that I'm getting, you know. They're saying that, ""hey, you know ... that isn't for me"" kind of thing, you know. And that's before, you know, I'd like to work with that, and ride it ... like to try to communicate without alienating ...  people or whatever, but now, you know, I'm ending up saying, you know, like ...""hey, that's a bunch of crap"",  you know. ""Don't ... don't, don't tell me about the way that I should do it or, or give me all that nonverbal stuff about, um, you saying that I'm OK, but by nonverbally saying ... ""hey"", you know, ""you're really not OK"", you know. And I don't want to hear that kind of stuff anymore."
Client,23,":  ... But I don't, you know ... it's hard to know how to be angry, you know ... hard to ..."
Client,24,Mmm.
Client,25,": You really believe that? Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 88"
Client,26,":  Well.   I'm not sure how to respond to that at all, you know, because a part of that anger is, you know, the ... the hurt, and maybe if I’m... maybe what's happening is that if I'm ... if I become angry and I really let it hang out, that I really will see how hurt I am."
Client,27,": And um, you know, that just came to me as you were talking."
Client,28,": That, you know ..."
Client,29,: For sure.
Client,30,: Really.
Client,31,":  Um, whew ...  I keep getting these blocks, you know ... these, you know ... when I come to something like that, you know, because, you know, to me that's a revelation and I'm not really sure that, uh, risking being angry I guess ...  or something like that, you know."
Client,32,": Losing control, maybe."
Client,33,: You know?  Well ... .
Client,34,": I really don't know, I think that ... Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 89"
Client,35,": Right. And it's, you know ... I hadn't really thought about that before."
Client,36,": Yeah. It's, uh ... I guess I would be ... and I'd re-really would admit openly that I'm hurt. I, I said that I've been hurt."
Client,37,": And I think, you know, that I, I feel I've been hurt, but to really ... to show that, you know ..."
Client,38,": Yeah, I, I don't know. It ... it's, it, it's as scary, I think, as the possibility of ... that I had before ... more than before, about dying, you know."
Client,39,": And maybe, you know ... guess I was really scared because of the symptoms, you know, of, of, you know ... not being able to walk and not being able to see, and things like that, you know. And having to depend on somebody, you know. And for God's sake, you know ... having to show somebody that I'm ... that I'm hurt. And how, you know, how can I trust that to somebody,  you know. Umm ..."
Client,40,": Yeah, it is . Seems to be getting bigger and bigger as we talk!"
Client,41,":  Right.  Yeah. I'd like to just to say it's my ... it’s trying my conditioning. I try not to ... one way out of it ... and, uh  ... But that ... that isn't really acceptable to me now because I ... I, I, I, I feel that I ... I feel like ... that I have to express that, that hurt or whatever, but you know, I can say that, you know, and I know right down here, you know, I'm ... I'm saying that and when I say it, you know, it kind of keeps something down here. , you know."
Client,42,": For sure. For sure . I don't know how to do that exactly ... whatever ... It's like I don't drink a lot, you know, because I don't really want to, uh ...  ... experience that kind of, uh, you know ... alcohol to me is a depressant anyway, and um, you know ... that's about the only thing I really like to get out ... to really get out, you know, and maybe saying, you know, like I'll love somebody. ""I gave of myself"". I did the ... hell ... the best I could, and it wasn't good enough, you know, and you know, demand on top of demand and everything like that, you know ... It's just, you know ... Shit ... you know, it's, it's like that I'd like to be able uhh ... and I said this here, the other day or when I was talking to you ... that I'd like to be able to, to say that ... yeah, ""I was screwed over and I got hurt and everything else"", like that, or whatever, but it's an ... it's almost an admission in a, in a way on another level of, of ... of saying that they got the best of me, you know."
Client,43,: And I really don' want ...
Client,44,": You know, I really don't want anybody historically to get, have ... to have gotten the best of me ... but they did. They did. They beat the hell out of me."
Client,45,": Mmm. It is.   You know, being ... having it being all right to be defeated and be beaten and I don't know if there's any value in, you know ... maybe to myself ... admitting it to myself, or whatever, you know, but you know, I ... I'm really finding out I got a lot of , hangups in terms of, in that line that I hadn't thought of before, you know ... in terms of, you know, because I don't want to be beaten.  But I was, you know."
Client,46,": Because I think when you are hurt, that's being beaten except, you know ..."
Client,47,": And I allowed myself to, and I don't regret caring, and I don't regret loving or whatever, but you know ... like I'm a ... I'm a kid, you know, I'm a kid in a way. I like to be loved too; I like to be uh ...  ... some reciprocity. And I'm going to start, I think, expecting that. You know ... without being cold or anything like that.  But I have to, you know, start getting something back in return."
Client,48,": For sure, for sure.  And I don't want to have, uh get in the situation like I'm in now, you know, where I'm afraid to, to, to, show anybody that I am, I'm hurt, you know.  Scared to death ... terrified."
Client,49,": Sure, sure. It's, you know ... it has something to do with being a man and it has something to do with ... with the race thing, you know."
Client,50,: It has something to do with the relationship ...
Client,51,": Maybe the failure of a relationship, uh. A ... a lot of things, you know ... a father not being in the home with his children."
Client,52,":  You know, I really feel like being a victim."
Client,53,":  I don't know how to get that up at all.  Every time I get close to that, I take a drink of water!   Uh, I don't know if that acts to keep it down there or what."
Client,54,": For sure. I, I don't know. See, how it, it really isn't what I want either. You know, I want it to get out and stay out, you know."
Client,55,": Yeah. So maybe if you have any  exorcism type powers or whatever,  that, uh ... maybe you can just do that and then I'll be free of that, you know. Because that's what it feels like ... it feels like there's something there, you know, that I really ... and I've identified it. I think I've identified it, you know, because I know there're some times when there’s such a big lump in my throat, you know, and that I explain, I give myself a lot of reasons why I shouldn't be feeling like that, you know."
Client,56,": Right.  Yeah. You know, I, I, I never believe in cookbook answers to anything, even when I cook I don't use a cookbook. I just don't believe in it. I think, but I'd really like to be able for somebody to tell me  to, you know, maybe how to do that in about five minutes  and be through with it so I can live the rest of my life in peace.  You know what I mean?"
Client,57,: For sure.
Client,58,: For sure.  I have a suspicion that maybe you know some things that I don't know.
Client,59,: Mmm.
Client,60,": Hey, I, I believe that. I, I ... it feels like I'm holding out on myself ...  You know. But hell, you know. I don't know."
Client,61,: Yeah.
Client,62,": Mmm, yeah. And I don't know what, you know, I don't know if I have any control over that,  you know, of what, of what ... of what would happen, you know. It's like a friend of mine the other day, who helped me through my illness and everything, he says, you know, when I've encountered another person that, you know, a very intelligent sort that was talking a bunch of intellectual garbage about feelings and things like that ... that I really wa ... wanted to just, to, you know, I really saw the ... him ... the society, the culture, right in him, you know.  And I really wanted to just ... to kind of deck him, you know, and that's something that's not uh my nature whatever, but I could just really wonder that ..."
Client,63,": Yeah, yeah. And my friend said, you know, ""one of these days"", he says, if you ... ""if you don't get it together"" or, or something, he says ... not ""that if you don't get it together"", but he says, ""one of these days you're gonna really lose it, you know"". You know what I mean? It ... it's that I want to get rid of all that stuff that was done to me and not have to hear all that other stuff,  or to be able to deal with it in a very  constructive kind of a way, you know. But still it grinds me because of all the other stuff that's happened to me.  And when I see other people doing it to other people, or whatever, it grinds me ... it makes me angry, you know? And I would think that in those situations, I've begun to kind of strike out, you know, or like you know, protecting somebody else or fighting for somebody else or whatever, and like I'm not sure what I did for myself, though, over those years that all that happened to me or whatever.  Annnd, if I could cry and have it be all right..."
Client,64,": Yeah. It would, you know, but that's, that's a trip, you know ... that's a trip like uh..."
Client,65,": Yeah. For sure, for sure. That's a fact."
Client,66,": For sure, for sure.  Uhh, I don't know.  I don't know. Maybe going to a movie or one of those old, you know,  movies, dramas, or something like that ..."
Client,67,": Right ... so I can cry, you know, and have an excuse to cry, you know, but crying for myself, I'm not sure that, uh ... I'm just not sure that's going to be constructive, you know ."
Client,68,": I may be, I may be, because if I feel like crying and I don't, whenever there's some Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 94 things that are, you know ... but you see, that's a part of it too, you know? It's ... you know, and I, and I can't ... I, I hate to keep using these things of, you know, we're just being so conditioned not to, you know, from a little thing of, you know, like oh, you know, ""be little, little men or big boys"", or whatever. ""Don't cry"", and, and ..."
Client,69,": Yeah, for sure. I cried, I remember crying, but I cried alone. I never let anybody see me cry, you know? I wonder how many people have seen me cry!   Two or three in the whole world. It's kind of interesting, you know. I remember living with my ex-wife, or whatever, she cried all the time. She cried getting up in the morning, and you know, just crying for crying, you know. I asked her sometimes about why she cried, and she just said, ""I don't know, just wanted to, felt good"". I don't know if that was healthy or whatever, but it probably is a lot more healthier than what I did."
Client,70,": Right. There's just so many other ways to do it, you know, that I've learned, you know, like working hard.  Not thinking about it,  you know. Not thinking about it."
Client,71,: For sure.
Client,72,": For sure. Yeah. And I really don't know how to de ... and I really don't know how to deal with that. I really don't. I really don't.  You know, just really giving so much of yourself and it's really crazy. Too much. ."
Client,73,": Well, just you know, all those, you know, hours that I, you know, that I spent away from my family and that I gave up my family and didn't see my children grow, you know. I really wanted that to be for some kind of a higher level, some kind of a cause, you know. But not to have that uh, to see anything, any benefit that I did. You know, all of that work, I mean, hours and hours and ... but it's just incredible, and I think that would be one, you know, I was saying, ""Damn it, why in the hell did I spend so much time?""  ""Why did I spend so much time?"". You know, the leukemia, the ... everything that happened to me or whatever would be properly deserved if one person's life would have been changed, or something, you know.  And like, and maybe, maybe it has or whatever, but, but I think that I, I Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 95 don't trust that ... that it was worth it, you see?"
Client,74,"Yeah, and I'd also like to uh just kind of cry for my father-in-law too, who was killed before I ...  about six months before I got the leukemia.  I'd like to really tell him that I uh, that I really loved him a great deal."
Client,75,": Well, I, I really would, you know. Th-thisss situation that we started out ... I was married, and we married somebody of a different race, and we fought it out tooth and nail or whatever, and but, but yet we loved each other and we fished together and he was great with me. You know, he had a very ... to other people, a very cold way, you know, of, you know, ""By God, this is the way it's going to be"" and so forth. But I saw him when he was hurt too, and um when he was killed in, in 1975, in a, in a hunting accident, it just really took all of it, you know.  Because you see, he helped me to, to try to get out of that stuff. He's saying, ""Hey, what are you doing, you know? Do ... what do you really want to do?"". And at the time I wanted to, you know, to open my own restaurant or whatever.  And so he was going to help me finance that restaurant, you know. And so a week later he was killed. One week. And um, and so we were getting so close, but that I really never told him that, ""Hey Dad, you know, hey Dad, I love you, I really love you"". And we told each other, I guess, in some ways or whatever, but it's not the same as saying it, you know, as saying, ""Dad, I really love you. I really care""."
Client,76,": For sure, for sure, because he was straighter th ... with me than a lot of people, you know."
Client,77,": And to now to be taken away from all of that, you see, because it's only been, I don't know, eight months or so since I ceased all communication with my family, you know, family that ... my wife's family that I've loved and I've cared for and that I buried my father-in-law and that was it. That was the ... and then even the family began to take on those same things of the culture, you know."
Client,78,": For sure, for sure, you know. And lately, I don't know, falling apart or at least my being able to see that uh that it really wasn't, it wasn't true.  It wasn't real, I wasn't getting, I wasn't getting anything back, I wasn't getting any nourishment back, you know.  Smiles and polite kisses and things like that, you know. That is, you know, part of the hurt, you know. I'd rather for somebody to say, you know, ""I think you're a lousy S.O.B. or whatever"", as opposed to saying, ""Hello, dear, how are you?"" You know, you know?."
Client,79,": Right, right, you know."
Client,80,": . Yeah, so there's, you know, there's a few things."
Client,81,": I ... yeah, I think I would, you know. And just maybe I still think that I really wish that I could, you know, just say, ""Hey, you know, you guys, you really don't realize what you did to me"", you know? Because for a while, I just, you know, saying, well, you know, ""racist"", ""terrible"", ""blah, blah, blah"". But that doesn't say anything, you know, because it doesn't say how I really feel, you know.  But they, but it, but it ... they wouldn't understand that, they wouldn't understand how a black person could be hurt, you know, because if you don't accept a person as human, how can you, how can you think about, you know, like ... it's like thinking a dog could be hurt of whatever, you know, people that don't have dogs and don't understand them, you know?"
Client,82,: Yeah.
Client,83,": I just don't think I could do that 'cause I just don't think that that that, I just don't trust, you know, you know, I wouldn't do it because I just wouldn't want to give them the satisfaction, you know. It's like I feel like, you know, my saying, you know, ""Maybe that is my feeling"". But I, I have too many times, you know, when you know, I opened up a little bit or whatever, and someone says ...  ... you know, squash! Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 97"
Client,84,": For sure. Mmm. I maybe think that you can understand that a little bit in terms of about hurt and that, you know, that ... you know, that I, you know, that I'm a person and uh,  you know, I'm a person. And I don't really want that denied to me ...  you know, ever again."
Client,85,: You know. I could really get angry.
Client,86,": I don't you know, I just ... that's not going to happen to me, you know. In a way, you know, I don't want to love anybody like I did my father-in-law again, and for God's sake, you know, that's, that's painful, but I know that's terribly sick too, that you have to love, you have to continue to love people. Or whatever. But at that time, it was the only thing that was productive. It was the only thing that was something that was, you know, as Fromm talks about, biophilic. It was growth; it was nourishing. And that was the only thing, and that was just taken away from me, and it was taken away from me just ..."
Client,87,": You know, It was just really strange, you know."
Client,88,": For sure, for sure. For sure. I certainly don't want any more in-laws. . Be they uh whatever color. I'm not sure I want them, but now you know ... And that's ... I think that's part of it, you know. More so than, than the risking loving somebody, just because their death ... death I know is inevitable. But it's that, that other collection of things around it, or whatever. But you know, it's... it’s crazy."
Client,89,": It's crazy to love, you know, it's just like loving a pet rock or something, you know, it's nothing. Nothing, you don't feel."
Client,90,": Right. And I'm not so sure that that, that I want that, it to work like that again, you know. And maybe by ... maybe saying that, I don't know, maybe you know, calling, Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 98 say, ""Hey, I really was hurt"" and everything like that or whatever. Maybe that would be a start or whatever, but I just don't really trust that they really understand that.  I don't really, really uh ... it took my wife who lived with me for seven years, you know, after I left, maybe six, seven months to understand that I was, that I was hurt, that I was ... that I was desperate."
Client,91,": Mmm, that sounds kind of, yeah, well, , so little chance for that group of people understanding me.  And I believe it. I really believe it, you know. It would just, it would be like me trying to, uh, to understand or to, to tell Dick Nixon or something about my feelings, that I just don't think he could relate to that,you know.  And I'm using, and ... and I'm really serious about that example, because he's so far away from me and my reality, and that family, you know, I found out was so far away from me and my reality that, you know, it was insane, you know. It was really insane, you know. So I think on one level I feel OK for loving them."
Client,92,: OK for loving them.
Client,93,": But I don't feel OK for sharing any more with them.  And sharing that hurt is just,  you know ... and maybe sharing it with other people would be OK. But I know I'm moving away from the other too, you know, that's really important to me right now. And I don't know ... maybe I won't ... I'm not rushing it, it just seems to want to get out and jump out or whatever, but, you know, you know. It's clearly must have really gone through ... my body really must have gone through some changes or whatever because, you know, something there is just keeping it, keeping it down, and I know all those reasons but I can't uh, I can't seem to muster that power to ...  ... to get it, to get that out, you know, to really, you know."
Client,94,": Yeah, for sure. But it really, it really helps, you know, um, 'cause it's, it's, it's just, you know ... it's incredible, you know, this is the first time I've talked to anybody that, you know, that I haven't really been in control. To some extent I've really given up a lot of control uh ... to you."
Client,95,": For sure. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 99"
Client,96,": A very new experience for me. Very new experience. And maybe I don't know if it's just not, just it's a function, function of that too, you know, or something, you know. Things are rattling around in my head now , you know. But all the other, it's just bullshit, and like I have been hurt and I really don't want to get involved anymore in terms of with people that can't return love and can't accept people. I just don't really want to get involved anymore. I'm sick and tired ... sick of it."
Client,97,": Mmm, mmm. Yeah. And I wanna be able to uh, to feel and to, and to cry.  And not to be afraid of crying, and, and not to be afraid of, uh ... I want to be able and I'm going to work for that. I really wanna work for that. I, I know I do, you know, I just have this thing, ah, you know. If I trust the doctors, I'd have them cut 'em, cut me open and get that out, you know, but I don't."
Client,98,": Oh yeah! . Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I, but do you, do you, do you, do you, do you feel that ... you know, like I really wanna, you know, tell you how hurt I am, but I'm not, I can't tell you?"
Client,99,: Yeah. For sure. Yeah. Don't know how to do that.  You know?
Client,100,": Yeah. 'Cause I want to get to it really fast, you know, because that's all a part of me right now that's really ... I really feel that's sick, that's really the cancer,  you know. That if I could eliminate that, I could eliminate all the cancer from my body.  I really believe it, you know. And I really blame, I really blame the way I lived and the stress and everything else like that on, on on the disease. I really do."
Client,101,": Right, for sure, yeah. I have it turned around. For sure. I do. I do. And to some Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 100 extent, I blame racism.  You know, I just don't want to get caught up into that anymore, you know, and I want to continue to give, but I don't, I, I, I'm just not going to do it the way I did it before. And uh, I don't know. May ... yelling sometimes you know, like when I came in here, I was thinking about yelling, you know, one of those long, big long ... you know. But I'm not sure that I want to do that."
Client,102,":  You know, I don't know, you know  That wouldn't be cultured."
Client,103,": Sure, I mean, I'm really, I was really socialized."
Client,104,": Oh yeah, I was. I learned all of it ... all of it."
Client,105,: Yeah. Yeah.
Client,106,": For sure. There were standards, I guess, and uh, that are really foreign to me, but uh, you know, the, the thing that, you know ... that I thought about you know, and like you know, I was like in terms of expressing my anger, whatever, comes out in terms of, you know , possible obscenity, you know , you know, like calling somebody a bunch of something or whatever would really, you know, I don't know what it would do, but you know, I'd really like to do that, you know."
Client,107,":  For sure, you know. It's not because of, you know, but I don't know, it's just a, a part of that, you know, like I was just ..."
Client,108,": Yeah, right, right, right. For sure.  Oh my goodness!"
Client,109,":  Oh, it's incredible. I don't know. Whew! I'm getting warm. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 101"
Client,110,": Yes, right, right. I'm getting extremely warm. Um, yeah, maybe I'll be able to do it one day, I guess. Maybe I'll be able to do it . I really haven't used ... but see, when I get out of here, I'll use a lot of profanity, you know. I don't, you know, just in terms of, you know, like I ... I, I, I, I think I did, you know, when I was really angry talking to my wife and things like that, you know, where I was just, ""Goddammit"", and all of that, you know, ""bastards"" and some other things and like, you know, I was raised properly, you know . Uh, yeah, but I think part of that would be a part of expressing my  feelings and everything like that, you know."
Client,111,": No, it wouldn't. It, it really wouldn't. It really wouldn't. To my teachers that I had, to the family that I had, uh, to a lot of my colleagues, you know, and others. And ... but I don't know if I really want to tell them, you know, maybe it's just a part of just being proud and, and everything else like that, but at least to myself I, I need to get it out and openly."
Client,112,": Mmm. Somehow, yeah, yeah. Really rotten and I really feel s ... you know, really screwed. I really feel ...  ... so badly."
Client,113,": Yeah, I know. They ... they got me, you know. It was just like uh, being part, I guess, that had something to do with being in, you know, I guess, you know, I just ... I just wipe 'em out, you know, if you don't get them with their bodies you do it in their mind, you know, like it happened, you know, and it was ... it was real, you know, and you know, to try to describe that hell to somebody is just the, the hardest thing, you know. But it's like, you know, just somebody knocking you down ...  ... and it's somebody coming and stomping on you and spitting on you and everything like that, and like it's just, you know, and just being at ... feeling like garbage."
Client,114,": And I have the feeling that people have made me feel like garbage, you know, and like ... you know? I'm sure that my friends would say, you know, God, I had everything. But I didn't have everything. I didn't have everything. Certainly didn't have that respect as a person. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 102"
Client,115,: Right. And it won't happen again. Not if I can help it .
Client,116,": It's 'cause I'm really tired of fighting.  Really tired of expending that kind of energy.  It really is just, is straining, it's too draining, and like, you know, I don't really know what's gonna happen in terms of, you know, how I'm going to do that, you know. Get it out or  or whatever, but you know, I just don't really want to say that I'm hurt or whatever, because that is ... that isn't even descriptive  enough for what really happened."
Client,117,": It really is, uh, I don't know if you saw ""The Excorcist"", but it really is, really is, you know, that oohf, you know, I remember a scene in that movie where the girl who threw up this green slime, you know, and that's really, it's that, you know, it's that bad, you know, it's, you know, it's that, it's that bad. 'Cause I know it ... I know it now, you know. It's not a part of me and my body really wants to reject that, but how to, how to throw that up is ..."
Client,118,": Yeah. Maybe I'm just afraid I'll look horrible, you know, or, or that I'd look horrible, or whatever, expressing that kind of anger, that kind of uh, that kind of hurt or whatever."
Client,119,":  I don't, I don't know, you know.  I don't really know. But right now, the ... more than getting that out, I think the, uh, the overriding thing is that I wanna keep at least that control, to control that, for fear of, you see, I don't really want to get sick again  You know, and like I think this, the slightest, you know, just by being weak, by submitting to that kind of pain, um, somehow bring back my uh ..."
Client,120,": And that doesn't sound logical, does it?  I know that.  Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 103"
Client,121,": Thank you, thank you very much.  Oh, God. What a ... mmm. . I don't know. God, you know, I feel so beaten. I ... when I feel beaten right now, and I'm not sure why, but that in a way the, that I got, uh ... I really got something to say and it just, you know, and I know I'd feel better. But maybe I wouldn't, you know, I really talk ... God, I realize how I'm talking in circles. I seem to be talking in circles. Does it sound like uh?"
Client,122,":  Yeah  Think that you know, just ... that turned, that almost turned me into something really inhuman."
Client,123,: I really almost let it turn me into something really inhuman.
Client,124,": Damn near, damn near, yeah. So you see, if uh, I don't want that to happen anymore. At all. Not gonna do it to me again ."
Client,125,": No. I know that doesn't help the other problem, but at least I know that , and I really do know that, you know.  Because I don't think anybody has a right to do that to anybody. Nobody ... teacher, wife, husband, whatever. Uh uh, and it, and it really wasn't my fault either and uh, and like I'm not the blameless ... I mean, I'm not without any blame or whatever, but you know, you know ... just like somebody took a big goddamned tree and just rammed it up ... ooh, so, you know?  Hard to describe, you know, you know?"
Client,126,":  I, I didn't say that."
Client,127,: That's what I meant.
Client,128,": Yeah, for sure. You know, and you know that that probably would be painful. Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 104"
Client,129,": Yeah. . You just can't let it ... I just, I just can't let it happen again.  I um really, uh, I just really don't know how to tell you how badly I've been hurt, you know. I really don't."
Client,130,": Yeah. But I know, you know, it's there, and maybe I should attend to it a little bit more. But, goddammit, you know, just ooh..."
Client,131,": Yeah. I am. I was thinking a ... about a wino on a street that continues to drink, doesn't have a place to live. You know I've seen so many people go by, they're the kind of person, you know, disgusting, don't want to work or whatever. But you know, I really feel like there may be some reasons.  And I know one thing, I'm gonna allow that person to be desperate ...  Because I'm thinking that probably people like that do things out of desperation. And um, 'cause I know, you know? I never really had a drinking problem or anything like that, but it's the kind of sensitivity that I've gotten from all of that."
Client,132,": For sure. For sure. And I think that I ... I think my, my heart goes out to people like that, people who can't afford to to do this or whatever, and ... because see, I had a lot of money and you know, it all left. And uh, but in a way I'm happier now, you know. But I really don't know, not sure really where to go next, but I know that I don't really want that kind of life anymore. That I wanna give, I wanna help, and I wanna talk to people or whatever, and before I do that, you know, I wanna get my thing together, and a part of that is just maybe admitting, you know, and I guess maybe admitting that I'm hurt and showing and expressing my hurt or whatever will, will reaffirm the fact that I'm a person  Because apart from that, I think showing that is a, you know, pulling myself up too high,  you know, and that’s what everybody, you know, that's the way everything was."
Client,133,": For sure. But at least I'm admitting to you that I'm hurt, you know."
Client,134,": Oh, yeah, you know, when I, you know, what is, you know how your natural reaction, you know, when you start feeling stuff like that, or at least when I do, I just kind of, you know, I've got to put it all out of, out of my mind, bring it down to a different level. And I think that's what I'm doing, I keep doing, you know, when I get to the point. Gotta bring it to a safe level."
Client,135,":  For sure. You, you ... is it all right to have everybody else to blame?   You know, for your, for your problem, instead of sharing some of that. But I shared, you know, I, I, I think I've really, I shared that, you know."
Client,136,": Yeah, yeah. And I guess I hurt myself. I didn't, other people ... maybe if I can clarify that ... I let myself be hurt.  You know, because I just gave too much, you know."
Client,137,: Really. And not sometimes ... most of the times.
Client,138,": You know, by being, you know, just by being, by sharing, by being there, by giving, you know, and really loving. Because I do have that sense of a total, you know, that just, I wanna love, that's my nature."
Client,139,": But you know, I, I've really never been this beaten. I never ... you know, never have."
Client,140,": Well, through this whole thing, you know."
Client,141,": Just beaten, you know, just really beaten, and I think that if I show you how much Rogers’ Transcripts, Volume 12, Dione, 2nd Interview, page 106 I've been beaten or whatever, you know, like I'd probably, you know, become nothing in this chair, you know, just ...  You know?"
Client,142,": Mmm, for sure. For sure. You know, I could tell you some times I mean that would just, you know, maybe blow you away, you know.  ...  Really too much for me."
Client,143,: It's really too much for me.
Client,144,: I feel like it.
Client,145,": Yeah. Mmm, yeah, really.  When I start smiling, I know I am."
Client,146,": For sure.  Well, you know, but I'm being truthful about it anyway."
Client,147,: Yeah.
Client,148,": Yeah. You see, because I, I can talk about this leukemia and and all this stuff and everything like that and ...  well, I guess it's you know..."
Client,149,": Yeah.  Whew, oh, I really, whew, a lot, you know . I have to stop. OK?"
Client,150,: Right.
